    MODULE DATASET (IMD)
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation comprises the Phase 4 
Release of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD). 

The CSES Integrated Module Dataset is being released in a phased way. Thus, 
this release is an advance version of the dataset, and thus lacks some of
the checking, documentation, and inclusion of certain variables that are 
expected with the Full Release of this dataset. 

This Advance Release is provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset. We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the data and 
documentation of variables. If users wish to re-use their programming code 
on a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that 
is flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) may wish to monitor the 
errata for CSES IMD on the CSES website, to check for known errors which 
may impact their analyses. To view errata for CSES IMD Phase 4, go to 
Data Download on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES IMD download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the white box to the right of the page.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) are also advised that 
while the CSES IMD Codebook is comprehensive, users are strongly advised
to consult Standalone CSES Module Documentation including Standalone CSES  
Module Codebooks, Macro Reports, Design Reports, and Election Summaries.

===========================================================================
))) CSES IMD CODEBOOK: CRITICAL CRITERIA REGARDING CSES IMD AND 
    DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLE NOTES, POLITY NOTES; & ELECTION STUDY NOTES
===========================================================================

Here we provide a brief overview of some of the critical criteria regarding 
the creation of CSES IMD and some crucial things users may wish to take 
account of in analyzing data from CSES IMD.

Variables are presented in five groupings:

1) IMD1001-IMD1999 Identification, weight, and election study variables

2) IMD2001-IMD2999 Demographic data and variables

3) IMD3001-IMD3999 Micro-level (survey) data and variables

4) IMD5001-IMD5099 Macro-level data and variables 

5) IMD5100-IMD5199 Data Bridging identifier variables 

In the Variable Descriptions section of the CSES IMD Codebook (Part 2), 
the headers for individual variables are surrounded by two lines of dashes.

Users are advised to consult Part 1 of the CSES IMD Codebook for 
more in-depth information concerning the operating principles of CSES IMD, 
its coding conventions, details on identification and missing data, and 
overviews of the dataset including detailed summary information on the 
election studies included in CSES IMD. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> PLACEMENT OF QUESTIONS IN CSES IMD AND STANDALONE CSES MODULES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using variables in the CSES IMD, users are advised that even when a
question is worded identically in successive surveys, its placement in the
survey questionnaire may be different in each Standalone CSES Module, with
unknown effects. Thus, even when a question is worded identically in 
successive surveys, analysts may wish to examine the placement of the 
question in each questionnaire to ensure that changes in its placement do 
not contaminate analyses. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> RECODING OF VARIABLES FOR CSES IMD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables for CSES IMD have been recoded to be consistent over time. 
Questions (and variables) are not necessarily coded the same way in CSES
IMD as they are in the Standalone CSES Modules. Users are advised to 
consult the CSES IMD Codebook Part 2, where possible, details have been
provided in VARIABLE NOTES and ELECTION STUDY NOTES regarding harmonization
schemes and specific election study deviations. Users are also advised to 
consult Standalone CSES Module Codebooks for specific information on
Module-specific studies. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> DEVIATIONS FROM STANDALONE CSES MODULES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES goal is to keep deviations between Standalone CSES Modules and
CSES IMD to a minimum. Nonetheless, despite question wordings being
virtually identical across CSES modules, CSES IMD harmonizes variables to
be consistent over time, thus necessitating some deviations to occur. 
These deviations may occur because of coding errors found in the 
Standalone CSES dataset or Standalone Codebooks. In these circumstances, 
these errors may result in changes being implemented in CSES IMD 
and the issues listed in errata on the Standalone CSES Module pages. These 
issues will be corrected in the Standalone CSES Modules upon re-release of 
these respective Standalone CSES Modules at some future date. 

Deviations may also legitimately arise because of different coding schemes 
applied in Standalone CSES Modules compared with CSES IMD, lack of data at 
the time of processing of Standalone CSES Modules which has since become 
available, or that data for certain variables were not collected in 
particular Standalone CSES Modules but have become eligible for inclusion 
in CSES IMD as it meets the "3 and 1" eligibility criteria.

In line with the policy of minimizing differences between CSES IMD and
Standalone CSES Modules, CSES only applies deviations between CSES IMD and
Standalone CSES Modules when the above circumstances are met. In
circumstances where CSES is unable to explain why coding differs between
studies from the same polity over time, no changes are made to the data. 

Concerning deviations, Election Study Notes and Polity Notes are included 
under the applicable variables noting the deviations. Irregular codes 
discovered in Standalone CSES Modules and which could not  
be identified were set to missing. These are also noted in Variable Notes
and Election Study Notes. Users can identify these by using the following
unique search terms in Part 2 of the CSES IMD Codebook: 
   - VARIABLE NOTES
   - [POLITY NOTES]
   - [ELECTION STUDY NOTES]


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> VARIABLE NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variable notes provide information on the rationale of a variable 
as well as source information for that variable. It also details the 
polities for which no data for that particular variable are available. 
VARIABLE NOTES are listed below the descriptive information for the said
variable and can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for 
"VARIABLE NOTES" in Part 2 of the CSES IMD Codebook. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> POLITY NOTES AND ELECTION STUDY NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A unique dimension of the CSES are the inclusion of POLITY NOTES and
ELECTION STUDY NOTES. They are notes which are attached to each 
variable included in the dataset and refer to case-specific 
information regarding a particular variable. This information
may apply to a polity consistently in the dataset (i.e.: a POLITY NOTE)
or one election study in the dataset (i.e.: an ELECTION STUDY NOTE). 
Their purpose is to provide users with more detailed information on the 
case or explain essential deviations specific to cases from CSES 
conventions.

Where applicable, POLITY NOTES and ELECTION STUDY NOTES are listed 
below a particular variable and any VARIABLE NOTES in Parts 2, 3, and 4
of the CSES IMD Codebook. They can be navigated in the Codebook by 
searching for "POLITY NOTES" or ELECTION STUDY NOTES" in Parts 2-5 
of the CSES IMD Codebook.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> DERIVATIVE VARIABLES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES IMD includes several derivative variables. A derivative variable is a
variable that is derived from another variable or variables within the CSES.
Their purpose is to facilitate speedier analysis for users with derivative
variables capturing some of the most common analytical concepts in the
discipline.

A list of the DERIVATIVE VARIABLES are below this explanation and can be
navigated in the Codebook by searching for "DERIVATIVE VARIABLES" in
Part 2 of the CSES IMD Codebook.

    DEPARTURE
===========================================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - HARMONIZATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES IMD marks a radical new departure in the CSES approach to the coding of
parties and coalitions. All parties/coalitions or Presidential candidates, 
where applicable, participating in the election or the previous election 
receive a NUMERICAL code. 
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro-component of 
the CSES dataset: 

   - Who the respondent voted for in the current election (IMD3002). 
   - Who the respondent voted for in the previous election (IMD3004).
   - The respondent's party identification (IMD3005_3).
   - Party/coalition that best represents the respondents' views 
     (IMD3016_2). 

These codes are used to identify the following in the macro-component of
the CSES dataset:

   - Numeric Party Code Identifier for relational data (IMD5000_).
   - Party/coalition of the Prime Minister before the election 
     (IMD5008_).
   - Party/coalition of the President before and after the election 
     (IMD5009_).

In CSES IMD, each party/coalition receives a unique numerical identifier 
that is consistent across modules. This seven-digit numerical identifier 
contains information on the polity and a unique numerical value to 
distinguish the party/coalition. Hence, numerical party/coalition codes 
are harmonized across Modules within CSES IMD. 

The first three digits of the identifier consist of the three-digit UN 
Polity Identifier Code. The remaining four digits consist of numerical 
codes ranging from 0001 to 9999, with each party/coalition assigned a value 
that remains consistent across Modules.   
In assigning of the last four digits, macro data specialists have assigned 
codes with consistent leading vote-getters in a polity being assigned lower 
values. Beyond this, the allocation of the final four digits is random. 

The harmonized and consistent codes for parties/coalitions are detailed
in Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook. Users can search for the 
following term: "CSES IMD HARMONIZED PARTY/COALITION NUMERICAL CODES"


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In cases of a merger between two parties, the newly created party/coalition
receives a different numerical code from its previous incarnations. 

When parties compete in electoral alliances/coalitions, the 
alliance/coalition receives a different numerical code from the constituent 
parties that make it up. 

Parties/coalitions that merely undergo a name change do not receive a new 
unique code. Instead, a POLITY/ELECTION STUDY NOTE will note the name 
change.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - RELATIONAL DATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES IMD includes relational data for parties/coalitions. In CSES IMD, as 
in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an ALPHABETICAL 
classification with parties/coalitions where data is available receiving 
an alphabetical code (A-I). 

Parties/coalitions A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, 
ordered in descending order of their share of the popular vote in the said
polity's election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the 
party/coalition that received the most votes in the election, party B the 
second most votes, etc...         
Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are 
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In polities with multiple 
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated. 
In polities where voters have two votes (i.e., a constituency and a list  
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the 
national share of the party list vote (tier 2).

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a polity. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each polity's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
polity. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up are provided.

These codes are used to identify the following in the micro-component of 
the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition 
     (variable IMD3007_).
   - Respondent's likability of the party/coalition (variable IMD3008_). 

These alphabetical codes are used to identify the macro level information 
about these said parties/coalitions, namely:

   - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition in lower
     house (variable IMD5001_)
   - Election Results: percentage of seats for each party/coalition in lower
     house (variable IMD5002_)
   - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition in upper
     house (variable IMD5003_)
   - Election Results: percentage of seats for each party/coalition in upper
     house (variable IMD5004_)
   - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition in 
     Presidential election (variable IMD5005_)
   - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's ideological family placement (variable IMD5011_).
   - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's left-right placement (variable IMD5012_).
   - Number of cabinet portfolios held by each party/coalition before the 
     election (variable IMD5029_).
   - Number of cabinet portfolios held by each party/coalition after the 
     election (variable IMD5031_).   
   - Manifesto research on political representation identifier
     for each party/coalition (variable IMD5100_).
   - Parliaments and Governments (ParlGov) identifier for each
     party/coalition (variable IMD5101_).
   - The said party/coalition's Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) 
     Identifier (variable IMD5102_).
   - The said party/coalition's Party Facts Identifier 
     (variable IMD5103_).     

To allow users to see what party/coalition A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, variable IMD5000_ provides identifiers within
the dataset with detailed labels. In addition, Part 4 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook details the alphabetical classifications for each polity by 
Standalone CSES Module. Users can search in Part 4 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook with the following term: "ALPHABETICAL PARTY CODES BY CSES MODULE"


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING - RELATIONAL DATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES IMD includes relational data for leaders of parties/coalitions. In CSES
IMD, as in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an ALPHABETICAL
classification with leaders where data is available receiving an 
alphabetical code (A-I). 

Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular 
parties/coalitions or the Presidential candidates of these parties. They 
correspond to parties A-F (i.e., Leader A will be related to Party A in 
some way, Leader B will be related to Party B, etc...) 

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to 
parties G, H, I, but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each country's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary 
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency 
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots Leader G, H, and I will 
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders. 
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro 
components of the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's likability of the leader/personality in question 
     (variable IMD3009). 

To allow users to see what Leader A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook details the 
alphabetical classifications of leaders for each polity by Standalone CSES 
Module. Users can search in Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook with the 
following term: "ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODES BY CSES MODULE"


===========================================================================
))) CSES DATA BRIDGING: NEW FRONTIERS
===========================================================================

Data Bridging enables users to bring together information from CSES with 
other data sources. The concept is part of CSES Data Linkage efforts. CSES
has been a pioneer of Data Linkage with the inclusion of various 
macro-level data originating from other sources (e.g., The World Bank, 
the IDEA) directly in CSES data products, including in CSES IMD. These 
macro data classify the political system's characteristics and contextual 
conditions of a polity at the election time.  
Data Bridging gives users the power to build on the direct data linkage 
in CSES products by enabling users to easily link other data with CSES 
products. CSES IMD enables users to bridge data with other prominent 
datasets in political science by including standard identifiers at the
polity, year, and party level used by other projects to facilitate 
merging.

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the polity level
with the following variables:
    - IMD1006_UN       ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 NUMERIC CODE
    - IMD1006_UNALPHA2 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 ALPHABETIC
                                      TWO LETTER CODE
    - IMD1006_UNALPHA3 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 ALPHABETIC
                                      THREE LETTER CODE
    - IMD1006_NAM      ID COMPONENT - POLITY NAME
    - IMD1006_VDEM     ID COMPONENT - V-Dem POLITY IDENTIFIER
    
More details can be found on all these variables in CSES IMD Codebook 
Part 2 by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD1006_UN") or using
the search term "POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the regional 
level through the following variables:  
    - IMD1006_REG      ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS NUMERIC
                                      CODES

More details can be found on all these variables in CSES IMD Codebook 
Part 2 by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD1006_REG") or using
the search term "POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets by date through the
following variables:  
    - IMD1008_YEAR     ID COMPONENT - ELECTION YEAR
    - IMD1011_M        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - MONTH
    - IMD1011_D        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - DAY

         | MODULE 3 was principally administered between 2006 and 2011
         | but the 2005 German, Polish, and Norwegian study administered 
         | CSES MODULE 3 pilot studies in 2005, with the CSES questionnaire
         | for MODULE 3 finalized in 2006.  
         |
         | MODULE 5 was principally administered between 2016 and 2021

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1003
         |
         | IMD1003 is an eight-digit numeric variable that identifies an
         | election study within CSES IMD.
         |
         | IMD1003 is constructed from two components, variable IMD1006
         | (CSES polity code) and IMD1008_YEAR (election year).
         |
         | The first three digits are the numerical version of the polity
         | codes created by the United Nations Statistics Division
         | ("countries or areas, codes and abbreviations", revised February
         | 13, 2002), except for Taiwan (see ELECTION STUDY NOTE).
         |
         | The fourth digit distinguishes between multiple studies
         | conducted within a single polity, for the same election or 
         | within the same year.         
         |
         | The fifth through eighth digits correspond to the election year
         | as specified in variable IMD1008_YEAR.
         |         
         | Polities are listed in alphabetical order, followed by the  
         | chronological order of the study.  
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A1003          
         | MODULE 2: B1003   
         | MODULE 3: C1003 
         | MODULE 4: D1003 
         | MODULE 5: E1003

         | POLITY NOTES - TAIWAN: IMD1003
         |
         | As Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, the polity code
         | assigned to Taiwan comes from the International Organization of 
         | Standards (ISO) 3166 polity classification, which the UN approach 
         | scheme largely mirrors. 

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - GREECE (2015 Jan & Sep): IMD1003
         |
         | Greece held two legislative elections in 2015: The first on 
         | January 25, 2015, followed by a second early election on 
         | September 20, 2015, due to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras'
         | resignation. CSES IMD includes studies on both contests: 
         | A study pertaining to the January 2015 contest from CSES 
         | MODULE 4, and a study about the September 2015 election 
         | from CSES MODULE 5. To distinguish between the two studies
         | in CSES IMD, data in IMD1003 were recoded as follows: 
         |

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1004
         |
         | IMD1004 is an eight-character variable that identifies an 
         | election study within the CSES IMD.
         |
         | The variable is constructed from two components, namely: 
         | IMD1006_UNALPHA3 (Polity alphabetical three letter code) and
         | IMD1008_YEAR (election year).
         |
         | The first three characters are the alphabetic country codes
         | 'alpha-3' created by the International Organization for 
         | Standardization in their ISO 3166 Standard and shared by the
         | United Nations Statistics Division (see Variable 
         | IMD1006_UNALPHA3).
         |
         | If appropriate, the fourth character distinguishes between
         | multiple studies conducted within a single country, for the same
         | election or within the same year. If only one study is in place
         | for the election-year, this character appears as an underscore
         | (_).
         |
         | The fifth through eighth characters correspond to the election
         | year as specified in variable IMD1008_YEAR.
         |         
         | Polities are listed in alphabetical order, followed by the  
         | chronological order of the study. 
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A1004          
         | MODULE 2: B1004   
         | MODULE 3: C1004

         | MODULE 5: E1004

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - GREECE (2015 Jan & Sep): IMD1004
         |
         | Greece held two legislative elections in 2015: The first on 
         | January 25, 2015, followed by a second early election on 
         | September 20, 2015, due to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras'
         | resignation. CSES IMD includes studies on both contests: 
         | A study pertaining to the January 2015 contest from CSES 
         | MODULE 4, and a study about the September 2015 election 
         | from CSES MODULE 5. To distinguish between the two studies
         | in CSES IMD, data in IMD1004 were recoded as follows:

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1005
         |
         | IMD1005 is an eighteen-character variable uniquely identifying 
         | a respondent within the CSES IMD.
         | It equals the original respondent IDs from the Standalone CSES
         | Modules (A1005, B1005, C1005, D1005, E1005). Therefore, users who
         | want to merge additional CSES variables not covered by the 
         | present data set may do so by using this variable as the basis 
         | for merging.
         |
         | The variable is constructed from three components: variable
         | IMD1006 (CSES polity code), IMD1008_YEAR (election year), and 
         | IMD1008_RES (respondent within election study).
         |
         | The first three characters are the numeric version of the
         | country codes created by the United Nations Statistics
         | Division ("countries or areas, codes and abbreviations",
         | revised February 13, 2002).
         |
         | If appropriate, the fourth character distinguishes between
         | multiple studies conducted within a single country, for the same
         | election. If only one study is in place for the election, this
         | character appears as a zero (0).
         |
         | The fifth through eighth characters correspond to the election
         | year as specified in variable IMD1008_YEAR.
         |
         | The last ten characters are the respondent identifier from
         | IMD1008_RES, which is unique within each election study.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A1005          
         | MODULE 2: B1005

         |
         | IMD1006 is a four-character variable that identifies a polity
         | conducting an election study that is present in the CSES
         | IMD. The variable is constructed in part from Variable 
         | IMD1006_UN (UN ISO_3166-1 numeric polity code) and an
         | additional classification added by CSES.
         |
         | The first three characters are the numerical version of
         | the polity codes created by the United Nations Statistics
         | Division ("countries or areas, codes and abbreviations",
         | revised February 13, 2002).
         |
         | The fourth character distinguishes between multiple studies
         | conducted within a single polity, for the same election.
         |
         | Polities are listed in alphabetical order. 
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are:

         | components. The fourth digit in the Standalone CSES MODULE 4
         | was used to indicate the two components. Hence, IMD1006 differs
         | from all other election studies for the United States which
         | are included in the CSES IMD.

         | The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 
         | polities located primarily in Europe. The EU came into being
         | in 1993 as the Maastricht Treaty came into force. The Union
         | traces its origins to the European Coal and Steel Community 
         | (ECSC) established in 1951 and the European Economic 
         | Community (EEC) established in 1957 under the Treaty of Rome. 
         |         
         | Throughout the course of the CSES IMD, the European Union 
         | experienced two enlargement rounds of relevance for the coding
         | of IMD1006_EU: 
         |
         | On May 1, 2004, CZECH REPUBLIC/CZECHIA, ESTONIA, HUNGARY, LATVIA, 
         | LITHUANIA, POLAND, SLOVAKIA, and SLOVENIA joined the European 
         | Union. 
         |
         | On January 1, 2007, BULGARIA and ROMANIA became EU members. 
         | 
         | All election studies from the above-listed polities are coded

         | votes within seven constituencies that overlie the general

         | within four subsets of registered voters and over-sampled
         | subsets 1, 3, and 4 below, groups of particular interest to the

         |
         | IMD1007 differentiates between two sample components in the U.S. 
         | 2016 data, namely voters who cast their vote early prior to the 
         | pre-election interview (N=131) and voters who cast their ballot 
         | after the pre-election interview. Respondents who affirmed to 
         | have voted early were asked to report their vote choice in the 
         | pre-election survey.

         | independently drawn probability samples split along modes.
         | See CSES MODULE 5 Codebook Part 6 for more information.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2020): IMD1007
         |
         | IMD1007 differentiates between ten sample components in the 2020 
         | study. These ten sample components comprise two-digit identifiers   
         | which represent the following distinctions. The first digit 
         | (a "1" or a "2") differentiates between voters that report 
         | casting their ballot before the pre-election and those who report 
         | doing so after the pre-election interview. Voters who report the
         | former receive a code of "2" (and thus are represented by codes
         | 21-25, N=371). Voters who report the latter receive a code of "1"
         | and thus are represented by codes 11-15. 
         |
         | The second digit of the identifier classifies the respondent 
         | mode of interview and in certain circumstances, the timing period
         | in which the respondent was invited to undertake the interview.   
         | Respondents part of the 2020 sample are classified with a second 
         | digit (i.e., codes 11-14 and codes 21-24 respectively). 
         | Respondents originating from the ANES 2016 study and 
         | re-interviewed in 2020 are classified in codes 15 and 25.      
         | Further details on the sampling design are provided in 
         | Part 6 of the CSES MODULE 5 Codebook and in ELECTION STUDY NOTES
         | in CSES MODULE 5 Codebook Part 2 for variables E1009_P_.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1008_DEC
         |
         | IMD1008_DEC refers to the decade of the main election, 
         | notwithstanding fieldwork periods. In case of multiple rounds 
         | split between decades, IMD1008_DEC refers to the first round of
         | the election. For example, the Chilean 1999 and 2009 
         | Presidential contests featured two rounds, with the first round
         | taking place in December and the second round taking place in
         | January of the following decade (2000 and 2010, respectively). 
         | In these instances, data were coded according to the first round
         | (December 1999 and 2009).
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime 
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for IMD3001 specifying the main election for
         | each study in CSES for specific details.
         |
         | This variable is original to CSES IMD, and therefore there are 
         | no corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.

         |
         | IMD1008_MOD_ are binary variables indicating the CSES Module
         | which was included in the respective election study. For 
         | example, respondents from an election study with questions from
         | MODULE 3 would be coded 1 for IMD1008_MOD_3, and 0 for all other
         | IMD1008_MOD_ variables.
         |
         | The Standalone CSES Modules were administered during the
         | following years (inclusive):
         |
         | CSES MODULE 1: 1996 - 2001 - SEE BELOW
         | CSES MODULE 2: 2001 - 2006

         | CSES MODULE 5: 2016 - 2021 - SEE BELOW
         |
         | The official period covered in CSES MODULE 2 is from 1996 to 
         | 2001. However, the Portuguese election study of 2002 included 
         | both CSES MODULES 1 and 2 in their study. For more see ELECTION 
         | STUDY NOTE for Portugal below. 
         |         
         | The official period covered in CSES MODULE 3 is from 2006 to 
         | 2011. The questionnaire was finalized for data collection 
         | beginning in 2006, however, there are three pilot studies from 
         | 2005 covering MODULE 3, namely Germany (2005), Norway (2005) and 
         | Poland (2005).
         |
         | The official period covered in CSES MODULE 4 is from 2011 to 
         | 2016. A preliminary questionnaire was used for pretests in 2011 -
         | this version of the questionnaire was very similar to the final
         | version. The questionnaire was finalized in 2012.
         |
         | The official period covered in CSES MODULE 5 is from 2016 to 
         | 2021. However, one pilot study was fielded in 2016 for Greece 
         | which focused on the September 2015 election. The questionnaire 
         | was finalized in 2016.
         |
         | These variables are original to CSES IMD, and therefore there are 
         | no corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2002): IMD1008_MOD_
         |
         | The Portuguese 2002 election study was administered during the 
         | transition phase between CSES MODULES 1 and 2. Therefore, it 
         | covered both the MODULE 1 and the MODULE 2 questionnaire. 
         | Respondents from the 2002 Portuguese study are thus coded
         | "1" in both IMD1008_MOD_1 and IMD1008_MOD_2.

         |
         | The 2001 Belarusian lower house election took place on March 18,
         | 2000. The Presidential election was held on September 9, 2001. 
         | The original election study primarily refers to the Presidential
         | election. However, leader evaluations, party evaluations, and 
         | macro data refer to the legislative election. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ISRAEL (1996): IMD1009
         |
         | Variables referring to the Presidential election in CSES IMD
         | refer to the direct elections in 1996 for the Israeli Prime 
         | Ministership. During the 1992-1996 parliamentary session, the 
         | Knesset decided to introduce a system of direct election for 
         | the Prime Ministership. The move followed the so-called 
         | "Dirty Trick" scandal of 1990 when Shimon Peres, then leader of 
         | the Labor party (Alignment), attempted to form a minority 
         | government made up of left-wing factions and ultra-orthodox 
         | parties, at the expense of the national unity government formed 
         | in 1988 and led by Likud's Yitzhak Shamir. While the national
         | unity government became the first government in the history of 
         | Israel to be dismissed by a parliamentary motion of
         | no-confidence, Peres was unable to form a government and 
         | Yitzak Shamir continued as Prime Minister, now leading a 
         | right-wing coalition government excluding Labor. During the 
         | attempts to form a Labor-led government, potential coalition 
         | members publicly demanded financial inducements for their 
         | support, prompting discussions of electoral reform. The direct 
         | election for the Prime Ministership continued in the 1999 and 
         | 2001 elections but was abandoned afterwards.

          Election Study Weights to compensate for a type of design effect.
         ..................................................................
         
         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1010_
         |
         | IMD1010_ detail the "Polity Weights" of the Standalone 
         | CSES Modules, originally provided as variables A1012_, B1012_,
         | C1012_, D1012_ and E1010_2. They report standardized versions 
         | (with a mean 1 within the polity) of the original weights 
         | provided with the component election studies. They are the ratio
         | of each weighting factor to the mean weight of each type, 
         | calculated within each polity.
         |
         | The derivative "Election Study Weights" (IMD1010_) have been
         | created so that for each weight (sample, demographic, political),
         | each respondent within the election study has a mean weight 
         | of "1". If you are running a frequency, for instance, this weight
         | will work so that the N in your frequency table comes out to
         | approximately the same as the number of interviews in the
         | study. This derivative weight is created by dividing the
         | individual weight for each respondent within an election
         | study by the mean for that weight for all respondents in that
         | election study.
         |
         | The STATA code used to create the derivative variables in the
         | CSES dataset is available in the original documentation of 
         | weighting variables, available in Codebook Parts 2 of the 
         | Standalone CSES Modules. 
         |
         | Use of weights is at the discretion of the analyst based upon
         | the considerations of her/his individual research question.
         | We recommend that analysts familiarize themselves with the
         | weights, their components, and their methods of creation
         | before applying them. For IMD1010_, users are advised to pay
         | special attention to the documentation of the original weights
         | provided by collaborators (A1010_, B1010_, C1010_, D1010_, 
         | E1010_) and the factor variables reporting the mean weight of
         | each type (A1011_, B1011_, C1011_, D1011_, E1011_), available 
         | in Codebook Parts 2 of the CSES MODULES.
         |
         | Additionally, analysts will want to keep in mind that these
         | weights are prepared to be election study weights, not country
         | weights. To convert the weights to country weights requires an
         | adjustment for those countries for which one or more polities
         | or election studies appear in the dataset.
         |
         | In the table below, we give an overview about what types of 
         | weights were originally provided by collaborators. More 
         | information on these weights is available in the Codebook Parts 2
         | of the CSES MODULES and in the Design Reports provided by 
         | collaborators.
         | In cases where a collaborator provides a single weight that
         | is a combination of one or more of the three weight categories
         | (sample, demographic, and political), the weight is duplicated
         | in the two or more appropriate variables. Thus, analysts using
         | two or more of the weights simultaneously will need to account
         | for this duplication.
         | Where a weight of a particular type is unavailable, these
         | variables are coded 1.

         | Sample weights include those intended to correct for unequal
         | selection probabilities resulting from "booster" samples,
         | procedures for selection within the household, non-response,
         | as well as other features of the sample design.
         |
         | Demographic weights adjust sample distributions of socio-
         | demographic characteristics to more closely resemble the
         | characteristics of the population.
         |
         | Political weights reconcile discrepancies in the reported
         | electoral behavior of the survey respondents from the
         | official vote counts.

         | The combined political and demographic weight (IMD1010_3) was not
         | constructed for 146 respondents due to the missing information 
         | on the variables used for constructing weights. These cases were
         | recoded to 0 for the political weight variable and thus, are 
         | dropped from analyses if IMD1010_3 is applied.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELGIUM-WALLONIA (1999): IMD1010_3
         |
         | For 447 respondents, the weight is set to zero. This is the 
         | result of missing data which was used to calculate the original
         | weight. Because the assignment of zero was a collaborator 
         | decision and the weights appear this way in the original data
         | deposits, no change was made.

         | We alert users that the demographic weight (IMD1010_2) was 
         | constructed on all 1,456 respondents. However, the study includes
         | 28 respondents who did not provide information on their year of 
         | birth. The voting eligibility of those 28 respondents can thus 
         | not be ascertained.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ITALY (2018): IMD1010_3
         |
         | In the original deposited political weight (IMD1010_3), 671 
         | respondents were coded as system missing because there was no 
         | information available for them on lower house vote choice 
         | variables. After consulting with the Collaborator, these cases 
         | were recoded to zero such that they will drop out of any analyses
         | in which the weight is applied.  
         | Because the voting age differs between the lower house (18 years 
         | and older) and the upper house (25 years and older), applying
         | any of the three weights adjusts the data for the lower house 
         | electorate but not the upper house electorate.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - LITHUANIA (1997): IMD1010_2
         | 
         | The 1997 Lithuanian study was meant to be representative of
         | the population from ages 15 to 74. Hence, the study includes 
         | 49 respondents who were younger than 18 and ineligible to vote
         | at the time of the election. The originally deposited 
         | demographic weight was calculated based on the full sample, 
         | including those respondents who were ineligible to vote.  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (1998): IMD1010_2, IMD1010_3
         |
         | For 287 respondents, the weight is set to zero. This is the 
         | result of missing data which was used to calculate the original
         | weight. Because the assignment of zero was a collaborator 
         | decision and the weights appear this way in the original data
         | deposits, no change was made.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2017): IMD1010_3
         |
         | For 90 respondents in IMD1010_3, no weight value was provided 
         | because one or multiple of the variables used for calculating the
         | weights were missing. 
         | The 90 respondents in IMD1010_3 were recoded to 0 for the
         | political weight variable and are hence dropped from analyses 
         | upon applying IMD1010_3.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PERU (2011): IMD1010_3
         | 
         | Because of compulsory voting in Peru, non-voters are coded as
         | zero in IMD1010_3 and are thus excluded from any analysis, 
         | when the weight is applied.  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PERU (2016): IMD1010_1-IMD1010_3
         |
         | Political weights were not constructed for 123 respondents in 
         | CSES Module 4. 105 of these respondents did not cast a vote in 
         | the Presidential elections (IMD3001_PR_1) and the remaining 18
         | respondents did not specify their vote choice in 
         | the Presidential elections (IMD3002_PR_1). These cases were 
         | set to zero for the political weight variable and thus, are
         | dropped from analyses if IMD1010_3 is applied.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2002): IMD1010_3
         |
         | The Portuguese 2002 election study was administered during the 
         | transition phase between CSES MODULES 1 and 2. Therefore, it 
         | covered both the MODULE 1 and the MODULE 2 questionnaire. 
         | As election study weights were not provided for Portugal (2002)
         | in CSES MODULE 1, the political weight for Portugal (2002) 
         | included in CSES MODULE 2 was adopted for IMD. The respective
         | weight adjusts for the 2002 electoral results.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2005): IMD1010_2
         |
         | The demographic weight was constructed on the basis of Census
         | 2001 information about the distribution of 18+ years of age
         | residents in Continental Portugal on the basis of sex (2
         | strata), age (3 strata), and education (3 strata).
         |
         | The demographic weight was initially deposited with 215 cases
         | having missing data. In the CSES data file, these cases are
         | coded "0."  These are cases for which at least one relevant
         | demographic variable was missing for the respondent. The
         | collaborator preferred to assign a weight of "0" to these cases
         | given that the demographic information was not complete for the
         | case.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2005): IMD1010_3
         |
         | The political weight was constructed on the basis of the 2005
         | election results in order to weigh the results of the vote
         | recall question.
         |
         | The political weight was originally deposited with 428 cases
         | having missing data. In the CSES data file, these cases are
         | coded "0."  These are cases for which at least one relevant
         | political variable was missing for the respondent. The
         | collaborator preferred to assign a weight of "0" to these
         | cases given that the political information was not complete
         | for the case.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SPAIN (2000): IMD1010_2
         |
         | For one respondent, the weight is set to zero. This is the 
         | result of missing data which was used to calculate the original
         | weight. Because the assignment of zero was a collaborator 
         | decision and the weights appear this way in the original data
         | deposits, no change was made.

         | election design. 
         | Conventionally, the CSES questionnaire is only included in post-

         | CSES questionnaire between rounds, or a limited number of 
         | questions before the election in cases where respondents were 
         | interviewed before and after the election.
         |
         | Wherever possible, variables collected post-election were

         | IMD1016_ detail the different interview modes used within an 
         | election study, coded on a study level and NOT on the respondent
         | level. For instance, if an election study used a combination of 
         | telephone and mail-back, variable IMD1016_1 would be coded as 
         | "2. TELEPHONE" and IMD1016_2 would be coded as "3. MAIL OR SELF-
         | COMPLETED SUPPLEMENT", regardless of whether all respondents were
         | interviewed using both modes or not. For mixed-mode studies, the
         | different modes used are classified in IMD1016_ in no particular
         | order.
         |
         | Some practitioners may be familiar with other terminology 
         | for different modes of interview. Below, we outline how some 
         | alternative terms map to the classifications used by CSES: 
         | - Face-to-face in-person interviews using a questionnaire on 
         |   paper are sometimes referenced as paper-and-pencil interviews
         |   (PAPI).
         | - Face-to-face in-person interviews using an electronic or
         |   computerized questionnaire are also known as computer-assisted
         |   personal interviews (CAPI). Sometimes, such interviews may 
         |   include self-administered components - for e.g. for questions 
         |   deemed sensitive. Self-administered parts interviewers give to 
         |   respondents as part of a face-to-face protocol are also known
         |   as computer-assisted self-interviewing (CASI).
         | - Telephone interviews are sometimes labeled computer-assisted 
         |   telephone interviews (CATI).
         | - Internet surveys are sometimes also referred to as computer- 
         |   assisted web interviews (CAWI) or computerized self-
         |   administered questionnaire (CSAQ).
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A1023        
         | MODULE 2: B1023    
         | MODULE 3: C1023

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - GREAT BRITAIN (1997): IMD1016_2
         |
         | In CSES MODULE 1, the British 1997 study is classified as 
         | "3. SELF-ADMINISTERED". However, while the MODULE 1 themed 
         | questionnaire was fielded as a supplementary drop-off 
         | mail-back survey, the preceding main interview covering 
         | turnout, vote choice and demographics was conducted 
         | face-to-face. Hence, IMD1016_1 and IMD1016_2 are coded

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD1019
         |
         | A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious disease that has spread
         | across a large region or multiple or worldwide and affecting a
         | substantial number of individuals.
         |                   
         | At the time of writing, COVID-19 was first discovered in November
         | 2019. However, it is possible human-to-human transmission of the
         | disease was occurring before this discovery. On January 11, 2020
         | the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified by Chinese
         | authorities of a virus outbreak in Wuhan, China. On January 30,
         | 2020, the World Health Organization classified COVID-19 as a 
         | Public Health Emergency of Concern before eventually declaring 
         | the Health situation as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
         |                 
         | An election (or election study) is classified as taking place
         | during the COVID-19 pandemic if the election itself took place
         | and/or the entire study fieldwork was administered on or after
         | March 11, 2020 to December 31, 2021, the end of the 
         | CSES MODULE 5 fieldwork. March 11, 2020 is the day on which
         | the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified the
         | COVID-19 Health Crisis as a pandemic.
         | An election (or election study) is classified as taking place
         | entirely pre the COVID-19 pandemic if the election was held and
         | the election study fieldwork was completed before March 11, 2020. 
         | This applies to all election studies from CSES MODULES 1-4.
         | An election which took place before March 11, 2020 but in which
         | the fieldwork took place both before and/or after March 11, 2020
         | is classified as an election taking place both pre and during the
         | COVID-19 pandemic.

         |
         | In CSES MODULES 4 and 5, respondents were asked to provide their 
         | month and year of birth. Hence, their age was calculated by
         | subtracting the year of birth from the election year in IMD. 
         |
         | Data are unavailable for KYRGYZSTAN (2005) and PERU (2000, 2001).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ALBANIA (2005): IMD2001_1
         |
         | Although the eligible voting age in Albania is 18 years of age,
         | the Albanian sample includes one observation aged 17.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (2017): IMD2001_1
         |
         | There are two respondents born in 2000, meaning that they were 17
         | at the time of election and interview for the Chilean study, and
         | thus neither eligible to vote nor to participate in the study. 
         | Data remain unchanged in the dataset. Collaborators note this is
         | most likely a typo.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - COSTA RICA (2018): IMD2001_1
         |
         | For 28 respondents, the year of birth is missing. The eligibility
         | of those 28 respondents is therefore unknown.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - DENMARK (2001): IMD2001_1
         |
         | Although the eligible voting age in Denmark is 18 years of age,
         | respondent's month of birth was not included in the study.
         | Consequently, the precise year of birth was not ascertainable
         | with potential differences of 1-year arising for some
         | respondents.
         | Consequently, although the voting age in Denmark is 18 years of
         | age, the Danish sample includes seven observations aged 17.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2019): IMD2001_1
         |
         | There is one respondent born in 2002, meaning that she was 17 at
         | the time of election and interview for the Finnish study, and
         | thus not eligible to vote nor to participate in the study. Data
         | remain unchanged in the dataset. Finnish Collaborators note this
         | is most likely a typo by the surveyor, and this respondent was
         | most likely born in 2001.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2002): IMD2001_1
         |
         | Although the eligible voting age in Germany is 18 years of age,
         | respondent's month of birth was not included in the study.
         | Consequently, the precise year of birth was not ascertainable
         | with potential differences of 1-year arising for some
         | respondents.
         | Consequently, although the voting age in Germany is 18 years of

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - LITHUANIA (1997): IMD2001_1
         | 
         | The 1997 Lithuanian study was a representative sample of the
         | population from ages 15 to 74. Hence, the study includes 
         | 49 respondents who are younger than 18 and ineligible to vote
         | at the time of the election.  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (1998): IMD2001_1
         | 
         | Four respondents reported being 17 at the time of the interview
         | even though the eligible voting age is 18. Respondents remained 
         | in the sample, as the original study was a panel study with pre-
         | and post-election interviews, and age was collected prior to the
         | election.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2010): IMD2001_1
         |
         | Although the eligible voting age in the Netherlands is 18 years 
         | of age, respondents' month of birth was not included in the 
         | study. Consequently, the precise year of birth was not 
         | ascertainable with potential differences of 1-year arising for 
         | some respondents.
         | Consequently, although the voting age in the Netherlands is 18 y
         | years of age, the Netherlands sample includes four observations 
         | aged 17.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (2001): IMD2001_1
         |
         | Although the eligible voting age in Norway is 18 years of age,
         | respondent's month of birth was not included in the study.
         | Consequently, the precise year of birth was not ascertainable
         | with potential differences of 1-year arising for some
         | respondents.
         | Consequently, although the voting age in Norway is 18 years of
         | age, the Norwegian sample includes 16 observations aged 17.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (2005): IMD2001_1
         |
         | Although the eligible voting age in Norway is 18 years of age,
         | respondent's month of birth was not included in the study.
         | Consequently, the precise year of birth was not ascertainable
         | with potential differences of 1-year arising for some
         | respondents.
         | Consequently, although the voting age in Norway is 18 years of

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (2009): IMD2001_1
         |
         | Respondents aged 76 years and older are captured in the single 
         | category 75, with the meaning of the code "Older than 75
         | years" in the Norway 2009 study. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - THAILAND (2019): IMD2001_1
         |
         | For 153 respondents, the year of birth is missing. The

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - UNITED STATES (2008): IMD2001_1
         |
         | Although the eligible voting age in the United States is 18 years
         | of age, respondents' month of birth was not included in the
         | study. Consequently, the precise year of birth was not 
         | ascertainable with potential differences of 1-year arising for
         | some respondents.
         | Consequently, although the voting age in the United States is 18
         | years of age, the USA sample includes three observations aged 17.
         |
         | The code "1" in the age variable in CSES MODULE 3 (C2001) for the 
         | United States study (2008) is re-coded into 90 for the

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2016): IMD2001_1
         |
         | Respondents who were 90 years or older at the time of the

         | Users are advised that the generational boundaries as described
         | above are primarily based on generational classifications
         | employed in advanced democracies. As generational experiences

         | economic events that might be unique to a polity, users are 
         | advised that generational classifications may differ in 
         | particular polities and these classifications, based on theory, 
         | merely act as a guide.
         | 
         | In CSES MODULES 1-3, respondents were asked to provide their 
         | age in years. Their year of birth underlying the IMD2001_G
         | classifications was calculated by subtracting their age from
         | the election year in IMD.
         | In CSES MODULES 4 and 5, respondents were asked to provide their 
         | year of birth directly (variables D2001_Y and E2001_Y). 
         | Hence, D2001_Y and E2001_Y formed the basis for grouping

         |
         | IMD2003 details respondents' attained level of education.
         | Following CSES conventions, the scale for IMD2003 is based on
         | the highest educational attainment, rather than on enrollment in
         | an educational program. For example, only respondents who have
         | obtained a university degree would be coded as "04. UNIVERSITY
         | EDUCATION". 
         | 
         | As there was no single unique coding classification for education
         | across CSES Modules, harmonization is based on re-coding 
         | education variables from previous CSES Modules according to the
         | newly created scale presented above. 
         | In what follows, we list how the original categories employed in
         | the Standalone CSES Modules were coded in CSES IMD.

         |
         | In CSES MODULES 4 and 5, the ISCED scheme was introduced to 
         | measure educational attainment, which includes two categories  
         | for secondary education, lower and upper. Respondents coded as 
         | "03. ISCED LEVEL 2 - LOWER SECONDARY" were coded into CSES IMD
         | code "02. PRIMARY EDUCATION/LOWER SECONDARY EDUCATION" to ensure
         | consistency with other CSES Modules in which the category 
         | "SECONDARY COMPLETED" referred to respondents who had attained
         | the minimum level of qualifications normally required for entry
         | into university or other degree-level higher education. 
         | According to the ISCED coding scheme, only the completion of
         | an upper secondary educational program would allow for someone
         | to enter a degree program. Hence, the two secondary education
         | codes from CSES MODULES 4 and 5 were split.

         | a religious denomination, nor a religion in which they were 
         | brought up were not asked about their religious service 
         | attendance. These respondents are coded "1. Never" in CSES
         | MODULE 1. This coding remains unchanged for the IMD. 
         | Further, researchers are advised that British respondents 
         | stating to attend church "less often than once a year" or 
         | "varies too much to say" are coded "2. Once a year" in 1997.

         |
         | Where deposited income data were not grouped into sample

         | IMD2006 was imputed by the Uruguayan collaborators, based on

         |
         | Instead of using the CSES coding scheme, some countries employ 
         | the amount of inhabitants for the size of respondents' place of
         | residence. These measurements do not fit the categories
         | generally used for IMD2007. Consequently, we advise users to
         | carefully read the ELECTION STUDY NOTES of the current variable, 
         | which are available in Part 2 of the Codebooks for the respective
         | CSES Modules.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are:

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD2008
         |
         | IMD2008 details the respondent's region of residence.
         | Regions are usually (but not always) based upon the social,
         | cultural, or historical differences (though some correspond
         | to administrative regions) that manifest themselves in
         | political cleavages.
         |
         | In CSES IMD, each region receives a unique numerical identifier
         | that is consistent across modules. This six-digit numerical
         | identifier contains information on the polity and a unique 
         | numerical value to distinguish the region. Codes are listed in 
         | alphabetical order of polity.
         |
         | The first three digits of the identifier consist of the 
         | numerical codes ranging from 001 to 999, with each region  
         | assigned a value that remains consistent across Modules. The  
         | remaining three digits consist of the three-digit UN Polity 
         | Identifier Code.
         | In assigning the first three digits, regions in most polities
         | were assigned numbers randomly beginning with "001". In cases
         | where this practice deviates, it is detailed in POLITY NOTES.
         | 
         | Users are advised to consult CSES Standalone Module Codebooks
         | for more details on how regions are classified in Standalone 
         | Modules.
         | In some polities, the region of residence variable was collected

         |
         | All Mexican studies included in the CSES Standalone Modules 1-4
         | employed the same scale for measuring race or ethnicity, 
         | distinguishing between Whites, Indigenous Peoples, Mestizos and
         | other groups. 
         | However, while the Standalone CSES MODULES 1 and 2 coded data 
         | for Mexico 1997, 2000, and 2003 into ethnicity, later CSES 
         | Modules coded data into race. The CSES IMD harmonizes coding
         | by including the available data in IMD2010 (Race). 
         | Consequentially, IMD2011 (Ethnicity) is coded missing for all 
         | Mexican studies. 
         | The following table lists how the original categories employed 
         | in the Mexican studies were coded in CSES IMD:

         | ethnic groups, namely: Indigenous people, Afro-Peruvians, 
         | Whites and Mestizos. As these groups match the IMD coding scheme
         | for respondents' race, the Peruvian data is coded into IMD2010, 
         | while IMD2011 (Ethnicity) has been recoded to missing. 
         | The following table lists how the original categories employed 
         | in the respective Peruvian studies were coded in CSES IMD:

         | [POLITY NOTES] - UNITED STATES: IMD2010
         |
         | The U.S. 1996 study does not differentiate between Asians and 
         | Pacific Islanders. Hence, the category "02. ASIAN" includes
         | respondents of either origin. Researchers are advised that 
         | respondent's race (IMD2010) was assessed by the interviewer, 
         | while ethnic identity (IMD2011) was reported by the respondent.
         | Further, the U.S. 2004, 2008, and 2012 studies included separate
         | categories for Latinos and Hispanics. Respondents classified as
         | either Latino or Hispanic were recoded to 96. OTHER in the IMD.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - CANADA (2008): IMD2010
         |
         | The race variable for the Canadian 2008 election study 
         | distinguishes respondents from racial minorities from other 
         | respondents in the sample. As this approach is challenging
         | to translate to the IMD2010 coding scheme, data for Canada 
         | (2008) have been set to missing in the IMD. 

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - GREAT BRITAIN (1997 & 2005): IMD2010
         |
         | The British 1997 and 2005 election studies included both data
         | for respondents' race (IMD2010) and respondents' ethnicity 
         | (IMD2011). Harmonizing data for the CSES IMD revealed that 
         | the British 1997 and 2005 data for ethnicity were collapsed
         | into more general categories for coding race in the Standalone
         | CSES Modules. Therefore, the CSES IMD includes the respective 
         | data in IMD2010 (Race), while IMD2011 (Ethnicity) is coded 
         | missing. 
         | The following table lists how the original categories employed

         |
         | The race variable for the Hungarian 1998 election study includes
         | data on the interviewer's assessment of whether the respondent 
         | was Romani or not. 
         | As the Roma are an ethnic rather than racial group, the IMD 
         | includes the respective data in IMD2011 (Ethnicity), while
         | IMD2010 (Race) is coded missing.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - NEW ZEALAND (1996): IMD2010
         |
         | The New Zealand 1996 election study included both data for
         | respondents' race (IMD2010) and respondents' ethnicity (IMD2011).
         | Harmonizing data for the CSES IMD revealed that the New Zealand
         | 1996 data for ethnicity were collapsed into more general 
         | categories for coding race in CSES MODULE 1. 
         | As data included in the ethnicity variable was found to be more 
         | accurate and fine-grained, IMD2010 was set to missing for 
         | New Zealand (1996). 

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - NEW ZEALAND (2008): IMD2010
         |
         | The 2008 New Zealand study differentiates between respondents 
         | of Maori and other origins. For the IMD, respondents of Maori
         | origin are coded as 5. INDIGENOUS, while the remaining 
         | respondents are coded as 96. OTHER.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD2011
         |
         | In the Standalone CSES Modules, IMD2011 was coded according to 
         | national standards. For the CSES IMD, these individual scales 
         | were harmonized in accordance with the coding scheme outlined 
         | above.
         |
         | Coding conventions for IMD2011 are based on the European 
         | Standard Classification of Cultural and Ethnic Groups (ESCEG), 
         | developed by Anthony Heath and Silke Schneider for the 
         | European Social Survey (ESS). 
         |
         | The ESCEG Classification of respondents' ethnicity distinguishes
         | between the following levels of detail: 
         | - Broad groups (1st digit) 
         | - Narrow groups (2nd digit) 
         | - National / cross-border groups (3rd and 4th digit) 
         | - Sub-national groups (5th digit)
         |
         | Where deemed necessary, ESCEG was extended for CSES IMD to 
         | incorporate additional ethnic groups. 
         |
         | Further, users are advised that the scale above only lists 
         | ethnicities represented in the IMD dataset. An English-language 
         | description of the full ESCEG Classification can be found here:

         | for Mexico 1997, 2000, and 2003 into ethnicity, later CSES 
         | Modules coded data into race. The CSES IMD harmonizes coding

         | for respondents' race (IMD2010) and respondents' ethnicity 
         | (IMD2011). Harmonizing data for the CSES IMD revealed that 
         | the British 1997 and 2005 data for ethnicity were collapsed
         | into more general categories for coding race in the Standalone

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD2012_1
         |
         | IMD2012_1 details the total number of persons living in a 
         | household - that is, the number of persons living together in 
         | the housing unit excluding paid employees and persons who pay 
         | rent for a room.
         | 
         | Some election studies include right-censored data for IMD2012_1,
         | such that the highest number of household members in the sample
         | represents all households of an equal or bigger size. 
         | One example is the 2004 Canadian election study, for which the
         | code 8 in IMD2012_1 is used for all households including eight 
         | or more members. 
         | Further, there are some instances in which respondents state to 
         | live in unusually large households or empty households (zero- 
         | member households).
         | These instances, for which data remained unchanged, are 
         | documented in ELECTION STUDY NOTES, which are available in the 
         | Codebooks Part 2 of the Standalone CSES Modules.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A2013
         | MODULE 2: B2021
         | MODULE 3: C2021
         | MODULE 4: D2021
         | MODULE 5: E2012 (see VARIABLE NOTES below)

         | in Total).
         |
         | Some election studies include right-censored data for IMD2012_2,
         | such that the highest number of underaged household members in 
         | the sample represents all households with an equal or bigger
         | number of persons under 18. One example is the 2008 Canadian 
         | election study, for which the code 8 in IMD2012_2 is used for 
         | all households including eight or more household members younger 
         | than 18. 
         | Further, there are some studies for which IMD2012_2 refers to 
         | the number of household members under the age of 16, not 18.
         | These instances, for which data remained unchanged, are 
         | documented in ELECTION STUDY NOTES, which are available in the 
         | Codebooks Part 2 of the Standalone CSES Modules.

         | with an unusually large number of children. These data remain 
         | unchanged. 
         | 
         | Further, there are some instances in which the number of persons
         | in the household is equal to or less than the number of persons

         | Respondents on "workfare" or enrolled in a government job 
         | training program are coded EMPLOYED.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A2007
         | MODULE 2: B2010
         | MODULE 3: C2010

         |
         | There is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status
         | (IMD2014) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (IMD2016-IMD2018). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in the
         | labor force in IMD2014 (codes 6-12), the occupation variables may
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupations that belong to respondents not in the 
         | labor force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.
         |
         | Some studies do not include information on the weekly working 
         | time. In studies distinguishing between "full time" and "part 
         | time" employment, respondents are coded as working full 
         | time or part-time, respectively, regardless of their actual 
         | weekly working time. Other studies group all employed spouses
         | into one general category. In these cases, respondents are coded 
         | as "00. EMPLOYED - NOT FURTHER SPECIFIED". 
         |
         | Data are unavailable for CSES MODULE 5, Brazil (2006), Denmark

         | There is some inconsistency for the Canadian election studies
         | in how answer categories for respondent's employment status
         | were coded in the CSES Standalone Modules. 
         | Data have been harmonized for IMD where possible. However, some
         | of the inconsistencies remain, as it was not always possible to 
         | disentangle the respective codes from other groups for IMD.
         | The table below provides further information on the affected

         | Self-employed respondents and respondents working at two or more
         | jobs were assigned election-study-specific codes in the Canadian
         | 2008 study (MODULE 3), but were recoded to "1. EMPLOYED - FULL 
         | TIME" in CSES IMD, in line with the other Canadian studies. 
         | Respondents who were retired and working for pay or caring for a
         | family and working for pay were assigned election-study-specific 
         | codes in the Canadian 2011 and 2015 studies (MODULE 4). For the
         | IMD, the respective groups were coded to "2. EMPLOYED - PART-
         | TIME" in line with the 2004 Canadian study. The same applies to

         | 
         | In the German 1998, 2002 Telephone, and 2013 studies, code 
         | "10. OTHERS, NOT IN LABOR FORCE" may refer to respondents either
         | on maternity/parental leave, within civil/military service,
         | engaged in a voluntary work program, or to other groups outside
         | of the labor force. Coding remains unchanged, as it was not 
         | possible to disentangle the respective groups for IMD.   

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - AUSTRALIA (2013): IMD2014

         | answers to IMD2014. In CSES MODULE 4, these cases were assigned
         | the code "11. See Election Study Notes". For the CSES IMD, they

         | CSES MODULE 4) and IMD2014 (Current Employment Status).
         | 
         | The IMD2015_ISCO_ variables report the respondent's main 
         | occupation; that is, the job at which the respondent spends the 
         | most time or if the respondent spends an equal amount of time on 
         | two jobs, it is the one from which the respondent earns the most
         | money. For respondents who are currently employed, these
         | variables report their current occupation. For respondents who 
         | are retired or not currently working, these variables report 
         | respondent's last occupation.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A2008
         | MODULE 2: B2011
         | MODULE 3: C2011
         | MODULE 4: D2011, inc. in IMD2015_ISCO_08 (SEE VAR. NOTES BELOW)
         | MODULE 5: E2007, to be included in IMD2015_ISCO_08 (SEE VAR. 
         |                  NOTES BELOW)
         | 
         | Coding conventions for CSES MODULES 1-3 employ the first two
         | out of four digits of the 1988 ISCO / ILO International Standard 
         | Classification of Occupations Code from the International 
         | Labor Organization, CH-1211, Geneva 22, Switzerland.
         |
         | As the 1988 ISCO Classification has been updated in 2008, 
         | CSES MODULES 4 and 5 employ this revised ISCO 08 Classification 
         | for coding occupation. 
         | According to the ILO, 2008 updates to ISCO "imply a break in 
         | series between statistics ... at all levels in the classification 
         | hierarchy" (ILO, 2008, p.22). CSES only makes use of the broader 
         | levels of the coding scheme, meaning that a multitude of
         | categories cannot be reclassified unambiguously. Hence, CSES IMD
         | provides ISCO 88 codes for CSES MODULES 1-3 and ISCO 08 codes
         | for CSES MODULE 4 in two separate variables.

         | In some cases, it has not been possible to strictly adhere to 
         | the two-digit ISCO/ILO conventions. Users will find that some 
         | categories have been added to the ISCO/ILO list to accommodate
         | the occupations of respondents who were not easily classified.
         | These include categories referring to the first digit of the
         | 1988 ISCO / ILO occupations code. In these cases, zeros were
         | added to preserve the two-digit structure (e.g.,

         | U.S. Census groups (71-category collapsed variable). 
         | In CSES Module 2, code 50 refers to the US census group "sales

         | them from general and retail sales workers coded as 51-53.
         | However, as the ISCO-88 scheme employs a separate category for
         | "Finance and sales associate professionals" (code 3410), the

         | 
         | The IMD2015_ISCO_ variables report the respondent's main 
         | occupation; that is, the job at which the respondent spends the 
         | most time or if the respondent spends an equal amount of time on 
         | two jobs, it is the one from which the respondent earns the most
         | money. For respondents who are currently employed, these
         | variables report their current occupation. For respondents who 
         | are retired or not currently working, these variables report 
         | respondent's last occupation.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A2008, inc. in IMD2015_ISCO_88 (SEE BELOW VAR. NOTES)
         | MODULE 2: B2011, inc. in IMD2015_ISCO_88 (SEE BELOW VAR. NOTES)

         | MODULE 5 dataset, but these data are not yet available in CSES 
         | IMD.
         |
         | Coding conventions for CSES MODULE 4 employ the first two
         | out of four digits of the 2008 ISCO / ILO International Standard 
         | Classification of Occupations Code from the International 
         | Labor Organization, CH-1211, Geneva 22, Switzerland.
         |
         | In the earlier CSES MODULES 1-3, occupation codes were based on
         | the first two digits of the 1988 ISCO Classification. 
         | According to the ILO, 2008 updates to ISCO "imply a break in 
         | series between statistics ... at all levels in the classification 
         | hierarchy" (ILO, 2008, p.22). CSES only makes use of the broader 
         | levels of the coding scheme, meaning that a multitude of
         | categories cannot be reclassified unambiguously. Hence, CSES IMD
         | provides ISCO88 codes for CSES MODULES 1-3 and ISCO-08 codes
         | for CSES MODULE 4 in two separate variables.

         | In some cases, it has not been possible to strictly adhere to 
         | the two-digit ISCO/ILO conventions. Users will find that some 
         | categories have been added to the ISCO/ILO list to accommodate
         | the occupations of respondents who were not easily classified.
         | These include categories referring to the first digit of the 
         | 2008 ISCO / ILO occupations code. In these cases, zeros
         | were added to preserve the two-digit structure (e.g., 
         | 90. ELEMENTARY OCCUPATIONS [NOT FURTHER SPECIFIED]). Please

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD2016
         |
         | The categories are intended to distinguish among the following
         | groups:
         |
         | 1. White Collar:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in non-manual
         | labor: Managers, salaried professionals, office workers,
         | sales personnel, and proprietors are generally included in
         | the category.
         |
         | 2. Worker:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in manual labor.
         |
         | 3. Farmer:
         | Normally persons self-employed in farming.
         |
         | 4. Self-Employed:
         | Self-employed occupations of all kinds, excluding self-employed
         | farming. Includes, for example entrepreneurs, shop keepers,
         | professionals like lawyers, medical doctors etc.
         |
         | For some studies, IMD2016 is not based on a separate survey 
         | question, but derived from respondents' main occupation 
         | (IMD2015). Details on the applied recodes for IMD2016 are 
         | provided in ELECTION STUDY NOTES, available in Codebook Parts 2 
         | of the Standalone CSES Modules. 
         | 
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: Not included
         | MODULE 2: B2012
         | MODULE 3: C2012
         | MODULE 4: D2012
         | MODULE 5: E2008
         |
         | The Standalone CSES MODULES 2-5 included two auxiliary codes
         | 5 and 6, for categories originally not envisaged by the CSES
         | coding scheme. For the CSES IMD, these codes have now been 
         | integrated into the above coding scheme whenever possible. 
         | The remaining codes were either set to 5. OTHER, with 
         | explanation given in ELECTION STUDY NOTES, or set to missing 
         | in cases where they concerned respondents out of the labor force 
         | (homemakers, full-time students, etc.). 
         | 
         | There is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status
         | (IMD2014) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (IMD2015-IMD2018). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in
         | labor force in IMD2014 (codes 6-12), the occupation variables may
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupations that belong to respondents not in the 
         | labor force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.
         |

         | 
         | The Irish 2007 study employs a binary variable for respondents'
         | socio-economic status, distinguishing self-employed respondents
         | from employed respondents. For both the Standalone MODULE 3 and
         | the CSES IMD, the self-employed are coded "4. SELF-EMPLOYED", 
         | while employed respondents are coded as "5. OTHER".

         | The coding scheme for employment type applied in CSES IMD 
         | follows the classification used in CSES MODULES 2-5.  
         | However, the coding classification for respondents' employment
         | type in CSES MODULE 1 diverges significantly from later modules.
         | In what follows, we list how the original categories employed in
         | the Standalone CSES MODULE 1 were translated into CSES IMD:

         | Further, some studies distinguish farmers and/or self-employed 
         | respondents from other employment types. In the Standalone 
         | CSES Modules, these groups were coded into residual categories
         | with meaning specific to individual election studies. For the
         | CSES IMD, farmers and the self-employed have been re-classified
         | into "2. PRIVATE SECTOR" as follows:

         | There is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status
         | (IMD2014) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (IMD2016-IMD2018). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in
         | the labor force in IMD2014 (codes 6-12), the occupation variables
         | may report the respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupations that belong to respondents not in the
         | labor force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.

         |
         | There is some inconsistency among studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status
         | (IMD2014) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (IMD2016-IMD2018). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in the
         | labor force in IMD2014 (codes 6-12), the occupation variables may
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupations that belong to respondents not in the 
         | labor force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are:

         | Further, users are advised that definitions of secondary and 
         | tertiary sectors differ slightly between CSES MODULE 1 and later
         | CSES Modules. In Module 1, these sectors were defined as follows:

         | There is some inconsistency among studies in the way
         | responses to the questions about current employment status
         | of spouses (IMD2020) were administered, affecting the 
         | application of the follow-up occupation variables (IMD2021-
         | IMD2024). The CSES standard is that the occupation variables are 
         | asked for those in the labor force. However, in some cases, 
         | for spouses categorized as not in the labor force in IMD2020 
         | (codes 6-12), the occupation variables may report their previous 
         | or last occupation.
         |
         | Some studies do not include information on the weekly working 
         | time. In studies distinguishing between "full time" and "part 
         | time" employment, spouses are coded as working full time or 
         | part-time, respectively, regardless of their actual weekly 
         | working time. Other studies group all employed spouses into one

         | Additionally, there is variation in the way the questions about

         | studies. In some cases, only those categorized as "married or 
         | living together" in IMD2004 were asked the spouse questions,
         | while in some surveys, other responses could also lead to a
         | respondent being asked these questions. Consequently, IMD2020
         | sometimes includes information about spouses from respondents
         | who reported neither being married nor living together with a
         | partner (IMD2004 is not coded 1.). These data remain unchanged.

         |
         | The IMD2021_ISCO_ variables report the respondent's spouse's 
         | main occupation; that is, the job at which the respondent's 
         | spouse spends the most time, or if the respondent's spouse
         | spends an equal amount of time on two jobs, it is the one from 
         | which the respondent's spouse earns the most money. 
         | For spouses who are currently employed, these variables report 
         | their current occupation. For spouses who are retired or not 
         | currently working, these variables report the spouse's last
         | occupation.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A2011
         | MODULE 2: B2016
         | MODULE 3: C2016
         | MODULE 4: D2016, included in IMD2015_ISCO_08 (See below)
         | MODULE 5: Not included
         |
         | Coding conventions for CSES MODULES 1-3 employ the first two
         | out of four digits of the 1988 ISCO / ILO International Standard 
         | Classification of Occupations Code from the International 
         | Labor Organization, CH-1211, Geneva 22, Switzerland.
         |
         | As the 1988 ISCO Classification has been updated in 2008, 
         | CSES MODULE 4 employs this revised ISCO08 Classification for
         | coding occupation. 
         | According to the ILO, 2008 updates to ISCO "imply a break in 
         | series between statistics   at all levels in the classification 
         | hierarchy" (ILO, 2008, p.22). CSES only makes use of the broader 
         | levels of the coding scheme, meaning that a multitude of
         | categories cannot be reclassified unambiguously. Hence, CSES IMD
         | provides ISCO88 codes for CSES MODULES 1-3 and ISCO-08 codes
         | for CSES MODULE 4 in two separate variables.

         | These include categories referring to the first digit of the

         | Occupation, CSES MODULES 1-3) and IMD2020 (Spouse: Current 
         | Employment Status).
         |
         | The IMD2021_ISCO_ variables report the respondent's spouse's 
         | main occupation; that is, the job at which the respondent's 
         | spouse spends the most time, or if the respondent's spouse
         | spends an equal amount of time on two jobs, it is the one from 
         | which the respondent's spouse earns the most money. 
         | For spouses who are currently employed, these variables report 
         | their current occupation. For spouses who are retired or not 
         | currently working, these variables report the spouse's last
         | occupation.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: A2011, inc. in IMD2015_ISCO_88 (SEE VAR. NOTES BELOW)
         | MODULE 2: B2016, inc. in IMD2015_ISCO_88 (SEE VAR. NOTES BELOW)

         | MODULE 4: D2016
         | MODULE 5: Not included
         |
         | Coding conventions for CSES MODULE 4 employ the first two
         | out of four digits of the 2008 ISCO / ILO International Standard 
         | Classification of Occupations Code from the International 
         | Labor Organization, CH-1211, Geneva 22, Switzerland.
         |
         | In the earlier CSES MODULES 1-3, occupation codes were based on
         | the first two digits of the 1988 ISCO Classification. 
         | According to the ILO, 2008 updates to ISCO "imply a break in 
         | series between statistics   at all levels in the classification 
         | hierarchy" (ILO, 2008, p.22). CSES only makes use of the broader 
         | levels of the coding scheme, meaning that a multitude of
         | categories cannot be reclassified unambiguously. Hence, CSES IMD
         | provides ISCO88 codes for CSES MODULES 1-3 and ISCO-08 codes
         | for CSES MODULE 4 in two separate variables.

         | In some cases, it has not been possible to strictly adhere to 
         | the two-digit ISCO/ILO conventions. Users will find that some 
         | categories have been added to the ISCO/ILO list to accommodate
         | the occupations of respondents who were not easily classified.
         | These include categories referring to the first digit of the 
         | 2008 ISCO / ILO occupations code. In these cases, zeros
         | were added to preserve the two-digit structure (e.g.,

             9. MISSING


         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD2022
         |
         | The categories are intended to distinguish among the
         | following groups:
         |
         | 1. White Collar:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in non-manual
         | labor: Managers, salaried professionals, office workers,
         | sales personnel, and proprietors are generally included in
         | the category.
         |
         | 2. Worker:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in manual labor.
         |
         | 3. Farmer:
         | Normally persons self-employed in farming.
         |
         | 4. Self-Employed:
         | Self-employed occupations of all kinds, excluding self-employed
         | farming. Included, for example, entrepreneurs, shopkeepers,
         | professionals, such as lawyers, medical doctors etc.
         |
         | For some studies, IMD2022 is not based on a separate survey 
         | question, but derived from spouses' main occupation (IMD2021).
         | Details on the applied recodes for IMD2022 are provided in
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES, available in Codebook Parts 2 of the 
         | Standalone CSES Modules.
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: Not included
         | MODULE 2: B2017
         | MODULE 3: C2017
         | MODULE 4: D2017
         | MODULE 5: Not included
         |
         | The Standalone CSES MODULES 2-4 included two auxiliary codes
         | 5 and 6, for categories originally not envisaged by the CSES
         | coding scheme. For the CSES IMD, these codes have now been 
         | integrated into the above coding scheme whenever possible. 
         | The remaining codes were either set to 5. OTHER, with 
         | explanation given in ELECTION STUDY NOTES, or set to missing 
         | in cases where they concerned respondents out of the labor force 
         | (homemakers, full-time students, etc.).
         |
         | There is some inconsistency among studies in the way the 
         | responses to the questions about the current employment status of 
         | spouses (IMD2020) affected the application of the follow-up
         | occupation variables (IMD2021-IMD2024). The CSES standard
         | is that the occupation variables are asked from those in the 
         | labor force. However, in some cases, for spouses categorized as
         | not in labor force in IMD2020 (codes 6-12), the occupation 
         | variables may report a spouse's last occupation. Hence, the 
         | responses concerning occupation that belong to respondents with
         | spouses not in the labor force presumably reflect their previous  
         | or last occupation.

         | Moreover, there is variation in the ways in which the questions
         | about respondent's spouse were administered in different 
         | election studies. In some cases, only those categorized as
         | "married or living together" in IMD2004 were asked the spouse
         | questions, while in some surveys other responses could also lead
         | to a respondent being asked these questions. Consequently IMD2022
         | sometimes includes information about spouses from respondents 
         | who reported neither being married nor living together with a
         | partner (IMD2004 is not code 1). These data remained unchanged.

         | There is some inconsistency among studies in the way the
         | responses to the questions about the current employment status of
         | spouses (IMD2020) affected the application of the follow-up
         | occupation variables (IMD2021-IMD2024). The CSES standard is that
         | the occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for spouses categorized as not in labor
         | force in IMD2020 (codes 6-12), the occupation variables may
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupations that belong to respondents with spouses 
         | not in the labor force presumably reflect their previous or last 
         | occupation.

         | Moreover, there is variation in the ways in which the questions
         | about respondent's spouse were administered in different
         | election studies. In some cases, only those categorized as
         | "married or living together" in IMD2004 were asked the spouse
         | questions, while in some surveys other responses could also lead
         | to a respondent being asked these questions. Consequently IMD2024
         | sometimes includes information about spouses from respondents who
         | reported neither being married nor living together with a
         | partner (IMD2004 is not code 1.). These data remained unchanged.

         |
         | The 2014 South African study does not distinguish between 
         | membership in business or employers' associations, farmers'
         | associations and professional associations. Instead, respondents 
         | were asked whether they were a member of one of these 
         | associations in one single question. Respondents' answers are 
         | included in IMD2025 (Business or Employers' Association 
         | Membership), IMD2026 (Farmers' Association Membership) 
         | and IMD2027.

         |
         | IMD3001 ascertains whether or not the respondent cast a ballot
         | in the main election, regardless of whether or not it was valid.
         | The wording of this item, which is to record voting in the 
         | national election, follows national standards.
         |
         | In case of a single election taking place, e.g., a lower house
         | election only, then IMD3001 reports the turnout decision for that
         | particular election. In cases where multiple elections took 
         | place, e.g., a Presidential and a lower house election, IMD3001
         | reports the turnout decision in the main election. 
         | 
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime 
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table below 
         | specifying the main election for each study in CSES for specific
         | details.

         | Even though the 1996 Presidential elections in Romania were the 
         | main election, the lower house turnout variable is coded here. 
         | The reason is that the Presidential turnout variable which 
         | was originally deposited refers to the second rather than the
         | first round of the 1996 Presidential elections.

         | There is a role in Switzerland known as President of the Federal
         | Council, with the title assigned to one of the seven members
         | of the Federal Council of Switzerland, which is elected by the
         | Federal Assembly (composed of the Council of States and National
         | Council) for a four-year term. Conventionally, the role of
         | President of the Council rotates among members, depending on
         | members' seniority. The President of the Federal Council has no
         | power above the other six members of the Council, and the role is
         | largely ceremonial. The President of the Federal Council is
         | not considered the Head of State - instead, the Federal Council
         | is classified as not only the Head of State but also the Head
         | of Government. Consequently, this variable is coded

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD3001_TS
         |
         | DERIVATIVE VARIABLE
         |
         | IMD3001_TS is constructed based on the respondent's reported
         | turnout in the current and previous main election.
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously,
         | IMD3001_TS reports the turnout decision in the main election.
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime 
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for IMD3001 specifying the main election for
         | each study in CSES for specific details.
         |
         | In instances when the previous turnout refers to a different type 
         | of election, e.g., current main elections are Presidential, but
         | previous turnout variable refers to lower house election only,
         | these studies are set to missing for IMD3001_TS.
         |
         | The data has been included in CSES IMD in the way it was
         | published in Standalone Modules. 
         | In some election studies, the previous turnout variable was not
         | asked directly in a survey, but generated from previous vote 
         | choice, under the assumption that all respondents reporting vote 
         | choice had voted. In other instances, the previous turnout 
         | variable was not constructed even when previous vote choice was
         | available. In this latter case, these studies are classified as 
         | "9. MISSING" for variable IMD3001_TS. 
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are: 
         | MODULE 1: not included
         | MODULE 2: not included 
         | MODULE 3: not included

         | (2007), AUSTRIA (2008), DENMARK (2001), FRANCE (2007), ITALY 
         | (2006), JAPAN (2004, 2007, 2013), MEXICO (2006, 2009, 2012,

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TAIWAN (2020): IMD3001_TS
         |
         | The main election in Taiwan is the Presidential election. Data 
         | on respondents' turnout of the second round of the Presidential 
         | election was, however, not available. Therefore, IMD3001_TS is

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SWITZERLAND: IMD3002_PR_
         |
         | There is a role in Switzerland known as President of the Federal
         | Council, with the title assigned to one of the seven members
         | of the Federal Council of Switzerland, which is elected by the
         | Federal Assembly (composed of the Council of States and National
         | Council) for a four-year term. Conventionally, the role of
         | President of the Council rotates among members, depending on
         | members' seniority. The President of the Federal Council has no
         | power above the other six members of the Council, and the role is
         | largely ceremonial. The President of the Federal Council is
         | not considered the Head of State - instead, the Federal Council
         | is classified as not only the Head of State but also the Head
         | of Government. Consequently, this variable is coded
         | "9999995. NOT APPLICABLE: NO ROLE OF PRESIDENT".

         | ballots of voters who voted for either a party list or a 
         | district candidate were treated as a fused vote, i.e., the vote 
         | for a party list was automatically extended to the lists' 
         | respective district candidate (and vice-versa, i.e., a vote for 
         | a district candidate was extended to the candidate's party 
         | list). IMD3002_UH_PL reports the votes of those reporting to have 
         | cast a list vote and those who reported voting for both a party 
         | list and a district candidate.

         |
         | In the 2018 Upper House elections, voters could vote for a party 
         | list only, a party list and a district candidate, or a district 
         | candidate only. For those who voted for a party list and a 
         | district candidate, split-ticket voting was not permitted. The 
         | ballots of voters who voted for either a party list or a 
         | district candidate were treated as a fused vote, i.e., the vote 
         | for a party list was automatically extended to the lists' 
         | respective district candidate (and vice-versa, i.e., a vote for 
         | a district candidate was extended to the candidate's party 
         | list). IMD3002_UH_DC_1 reports the votes of those reporting to 
         | have cast a district candidate vote. Respondents' vote choices 
         | for those who reported having cast a party list vote or both a 
         | party list and a district candidate vote were coded in 
         | IMD3002_UH_PL.
         | Respondents who reported a district candidate vote were asked to
         | to name the party list or coalition of the candidate they voted
         | for which was used to code IMD3002_UH_DC_1. 
         | 48 Respondents named a candidate of one of the two large
         | coalitions, i.e., the center-right and the center-left 
         | coalition. They were further asked which of the coalition 
         | members they liked most. The answer to the latter was coded as  
         | the respondent's vote choice in IMD3002_UH_DC_1 as coalitions   
         | were not assigned numerical party codes.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |  
         | DERIVATIVE VARIABLE
         |
         | IMD3002_OUTGOV ascertains whether or not the respondent cast a 
         | ballot for the outgoing incumbent, regardless of whether or not 
         | it was valid. 
         |         
         | IMD3002_OUTGOV is constructed based on the respondent's reported
         | vote choice in the current main election.
         |
         | In case of a single election taking place, e.g., a lower house
         | election only, this variable reports the voting decision for
         | that particular election. 
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously,
         | IMD3002_OUTGOV reports the voting behavior in the main election.
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. The classification of the main election by election 
         | study is listed in the VARIABLE NOTES Table below. 
         |         
         | In case of a Presidential election as main election, 
         | IMD3002_OUTGOV refers to the incumbent President and/or the 
         | incumbent President's party. In all other cases, IMD3002_OUTGOV
         | refers to the party/parties which was/were part of the outgoing 
         | cabinet. 
         |
         | In mixed electoral systems where voters have a list vote and a 
         | district candidate vote, the list vote was used to determine if 
         | the respondent voted for the outgoing government or not.
         |
         | In case of a caretaker government, the party affiliation of its 
         | members was used to code IMD3002_OUTGOV. Cabinet members without
         | a formal party affiliation were not considered for this variable.
         |
         | For election studies included in CSES MODULES 1 and 2, the coding
         | was based on a variety of sources. For CSES MODULES 3 and 4, the 
         | information in the macro variables about the party of the
         | incumbent President and the cabinet membership were used.

         | POLITY NOTES - HONG KONG: IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The Chief Executive (CE) in Hong Kong is the highest government 
         | official, but they do not belong to any political party. Hence, 
         | IMD3002_OUTGOV was coded as "9999996. NOT ASCERTAINED/INCUMBENT

         | POLITY NOTES - SWITZERLAND: IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The Federal Council of Switzerland functions as the collective 
         | executive in Switzerland. Because the Federal President rotates
         | among its members from each of the parties on a fixed, annual 
         | basis, no incumbent was coded. 

         | POLITY NOTES - SOUTH KOREA: IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | For all South Korean Studies in the CSES IMD, IMD3002_OUTGOV is

         | at the time of the respective election. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELARUS (2008): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELGIUM-FLANDERS (2019): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | This variable is coded for outgoing incumbents in the Belgium

         | for "Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&V)" or "Open Flemish
         | Liberals and Democrats (Open Vld)" are set to "1. VOTED FOR THE
         | OUTGOING GOVERNMENT (INCUMBENT)" for IMD3002_OUTGOV for the
         | Belgium-Flanders study.
         | The Belgium Government was also composed of "Reformist Movement

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELGIUM-WALLONIA (2019): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | This variable is coded for outgoing incumbents in the Belgium
         | national government. Thus, all respondents who reported voting
         | for "Reformist Movement (MR)" are set to "1. VOTED FOR THE

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2018): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | For Brazil 2018, respondents are coded as having voted for the 
         | incumbent if they voted for Dilma Rousseff's party, the Workers'  
         | Party (PT), in the current Presidential election. 
         | Rousseff was elected as President of Brazil in the 2014 election. 
         | However, she was impeached in 2016. Former Vice President Michel 
         | Temer (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party) succeeded Rousseff  
         | in office. 
         | Nevertheless, IMD3002_OUTGOV is coded based on voters for the 
         | Workers' Party because more respondents reported having voted for
         | the PT, and because Dilma Rousseff was the elected leader in the 
         | 2014 election.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (1999): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The incumbent President at that time, Tagle, was a member of the

         | support of the alliance, Concertation, which the Christian 
         | Democracy Party was a member of. In the 1999 election, however, 
         | the Concertation alliance supported Ricardo Lagos from the Party 
         | for Democracy. Because the numerical party codes in CSES MODULE 
         | 1 referred to the individual parties and not the alliance, 
         | respondents were coded as "9999996. NOT ASCERTAINED/INCUMBENT
         | CANDIDATE/PARTY DID NOT CONTEST." 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (2005): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The incumbent President at the time of the 2005 Chilean 
         | Presidential Election, Ricardo Lagos, was a member of the Party 
         | for Democracy. He was elected in 2000 with the support of the 
         | alliance Concertation, of which the Party for Democracy was a 
         | member. In the 2005 Presidential election, however, the 
         | Concertation alliance supported Michelle Bachelet from the 
         | Socialist Party of Chile. Because the numerical party codes for
         | vote choice in the 2005 Chilean Presidential Election 
         | (IMD3002_PR_1) refer to the individual parties and not the 
         | alliance, voters who stated to have voted for the Socialist Party
         | in IMD3002_PR_1 were coded as having voted for the party of the 
         | incumbent.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (2009): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |

         |
         | Prior to the election, the Czech Republic/Czechia was governed by 
         | a caretaker government led by Jiri Rusnok. 14 of the 15 cabinet
         | members had no formal party membership. Thus, only respondents 
         | who voted for the Christian Democratic Union - Czech People's
         | Party (KDU-CSL), the party of the 15th cabinet member, were 
         | coded as "1. VOTED FOR THE OUTGOING GOVERNMENT" here.

         |                        IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | For the Czech Republic/Czechia 2021, respondents are coded as  
         | having voted for the incumbent if they voted for the Action of 
         | Dissatisfied Citizens party (ANO 2011) or the Czech Social 
         | Democratic Party (CSSD), which formed a minority government ahead
         | of the 2021 election. 
         | While the minority government was backed by the Communist Party 
         | of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), this party was not formally part 
         | of the cabinet and hence, is not included as an incumbent party. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2019): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | Finland went through a government crisis in 2017 when the Finns
         | Party split. The Finns Party was a member of the governing 
         | coalition in Finland. In 2017, after Jussi Halla-aho was elected 
         | as the Finns Party President, other coalition members (Center 
         | Party and National Coalition Party) declared that they did not 
         | want to continue cooperation with the Finns Party. As a result, 
         | the Finns Party went into opposition. However, 20 MPs abandoned 
         | the Finns Party and formed a new parliamentary group, which 
         | continued to support the governing coalition and hold ministers 
         | in Finland's government. This group became a new political party 
         | in Finland - Blue Reform.
         | Thus, supporters of the Center Party, National Coalition Party 
         | and Blue Reform are coded as voters of outgoing incumbents. 
         | Voters of the Finns Party were coded as those who did not vote 
         | for the outgoing incumbent government.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREECE (2012): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The government at the time of the election was a caretaker 
         | government (May 6, 2012, to June 17, 2012). All of its members 
         | were independents. Hence, IMD3002_OUTGOV was coded as "9999996.
         | NOT ASCERTAINED/INCUMBENT CANDIDATE/PARTY DID NOT CONTEST."

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREECE (2019): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | After the September 2015 Greek legislative election, the 
         | Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) formed a coalition 
         | government headed by Alexis Tsipras with the Independent 
         | Greeks - National Patriotic Alliance (ANEL). However, ANEL 
         | left the coalition in early 2019 after disagreements over the 
         | Macedonian naming dispute. As ANEL further did not participate
         | in the 2019 legislative elections, only respondents voting for
         | Syriza are coded as incumbent voters in IMD3002_OUTGOV.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ISRAEL (1996): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | 20 respondents were coded as not applicable for the lower house

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ISRAEL (2020): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The March 2020 election was the third general election in Israel 
         | in the space of 12 months. Previous elections in April 2019 and 
         | September 2019 resulted in a hung parliament, where no new 
         | coalition government could be formed. Consequently, from April 
         | 9, 2019, Israel was governed by a caretaker coalition led by 
         | Benjamin Netanyahu as caretaker Prime Minister, comprising the
         | following parties: Likud, Kulanu, Shas, United Torah Judaism,
         | Jewish Home, and the New Right. The outgoing government variable
         | for Israel classifies this caretaker government as the incumbent
         | administration for the 2020 contest. 
         | Respondents who are classified as "9999992. OTHER CANDIDATE/PARTY 
         | (NOT FURTHER SPECIFIED)" in variable IMD3002_LH_PL are coded as 
         | "9999996. NOT ASCERTAINED/INCUMBENT CANDIDATE/PARTY DID NOT 
         | CONTEST" in IMD3002_OUTGOV.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ITALY (2018): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | In the 2018 lower house elections, voters could vote for a party 
         | list only, a party list and a district candidate, or a district 
         | candidate only. For those respondents reporting to have cast a 
         | list vote and those who reported voting for both a party list 
         | and a district candidate, IMD3002_OUTGOV was coded based on 
         | IMD3002_LH_PL. For respondents who reported voting for a district 
         | candidate only, IMD3002_OUTGOV was coded based on IMD3002_LH_DC.
         | Users are advised to consult ELECTION STUDY NOTES on
         | IMD3002_LH_PL and IMD3002_LH_DC for further details on the

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (2013): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | Because the 2013 Japanese election study in MODULE 4 referred to
         | the upper house elections, the incumbent variable was coded on
         | the basis of the lower house and the Abe government.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - KENYA (2013): IMD3002_OUTGOV
         |
         | The incumbent Mwai Kibaki (Party of National Unity, PNU) did not 
         | contest in the 2013 Presidential elections because of term 
         | limitations, which permitted him to run for a third term. Also
         | the PNU did not field a candidate of its own in 2013.

         | Bakiev, who had taken over the office three and a half months
         | prior to the election after then-President Akayev fled the 
         | country because of protests. Hence, IMD3002_OUTGOV was coded as

         | tensions within the ruling coalition. The same coalition formed
         | a new government with Maris Kucinskis of the Union of Greens and
         | Farmers as the new Prime Minister. Even though it was a turbulent
         | term, the same coalition governed Latvia from 2014 to 2018, and
         | those who voted for one of these parties in the 2018 elections
         | are coded as voters of outgoing incumbents for the IMD3002_OUTGOV
         | variable.

         | Presidential election.
         | Pena Nieto was elected as Mexican President to serve a six-year
         | term in the previous 2012 election. However, since all Mexican
         | Presidents are constitutionally limited to a single term, Pena
         | Nieto was not eligible for re-election. 
         | For the 2018 Presidential election, PRI nominated Jose Antonio

         | the party of the then Prime Minister, Nicolae Vacaroiu (Romanian
         | Party of Social Democracy, PSD, which was known then as the Party
         | of Social Democracy in Romania, PDSR).

         |
         | IMD3002_VS_1 ascertains whether or not the respondent reports 
         | voting for the same party/coalition in the current and previous
         | election or whether the respondent reports voting for a different
         | party/ coalition in the current election from the previous 
         | election. 
         |         
         | IMD3002_VS_1 is constructed based on the respondent's reported
         | vote choice in the current and previous main election.
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously,
         | IMD3002_VS_1 reports the vote switching behavior in the main 
         | election. 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for IMD3002_OUTGOV specifying the main election 
         | for each study in CSES for specific details.
         |
         | Respondents are classified as "0. DID NOT SWITCH" when they
         | expressed vote choice for the same party/coalition in the current
         | and previous election. In instances when a coalition is
         | competing in the current or previous election, and the parties
         | that comprise that coalition are competing individually in the
         | previous/current election, respondents who report voting for
         | the coalition and/or one of the parties comprising the coalition
         | are classified as "0. DID NOT SWITCH." Details of these cases
         | are specified in ELECTION STUDY NOTES below. 
         |
         | Respondents are classified as "1. SWITCHER" when their reported
         | vote in the current election differs from their reported vote 
         | in the previous election. Further, respondents are classified as
         | "1. SWITCHER" when they report voting in one election (current
         | or previous) for a party/coalition that did not exist or
         | contest in the other (current or previous) election.
         |
         | Respondents are classified as "9. MISSING" when data about
         | their vote choice in the current and/or previous election is
         | unavailable, if they report that they don't know who they
         | voted for, or if they refused to answer the question. 
         | Additionally, respondents who report voting for an independent  
         | candidate or other parties without further specification are 
         | classified as "9. MISSING."
         | In instances where current and previous vote choice refer to 
         | different types of elections, e.g., a current main election is
         | Presidential, but previous vote choice refers to the lower
         | house election only, these studies are set to "9. MISSING".

         | IMD3002_LR_CSES details whether or not the respondent reports 
         | voting for a leftist/center/rightist party/candidate of the 
         | party. The classification is based on CSES Collaborators experts'
         | judgment of parties' ideology and the respondents' reported vote 
         | choice. 
         |
         | IMD3002_LR_CSES is available for voters who reported voting for a 
         | party where expert judgments are available (i.e., for parties 
         | receiving an alphabetical classification by CSES). For more 
         | details on which parties/coalitions receive alphabetical 
         | classification, see "CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION

         |
         | IMD3002_LR_CSES differentiates voters based on expert judgments
         | of the CSES Collaborators on the left-right ideology scale. 
         | Collaborators assign parties scores on an 11-point scale ranging
         | from "0. LEFT" to "10. RIGHT" for all parties assigned an 
         | alphabetical code by CSES. The expert judgment data by party 
         | is available in variable IMD5012_.  
         |
         | The coding of IMD3002_LR_CSES is based on IMD3100_LR_CSES.
         | For IMD3100_LR_CSES, CSES linked the CSES Collaborator expert 
         | judgment with the reported vote choice of the respondent in the 
         | main election. A respondent who reports voting for a party/
         | candidate of PARTY A is assigned the value the CSES Collaborator 
         | gave to PARTY A in the said election on the left-right scale 
         | (and so on for PARTY B, PARTY C etc...). CSES reports these 
         | values in variable IMD3100_LR_CSES.          
         |
         | These scores provided in IMD3100_LR_CSES have then been 
         | re-classified for IMD3002_LR_CSES to establish whether a 
         | respondent voted for a leftist, center or rightist party/
         | candidate. Scores assigned by collaborators are recoded into a 
         | trichotomy as follows:

         | 
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously, 
         | this variable reports the vote choice in the main election.
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for IMD3002_OUTGOV specifying the main election 
         | for each study in CSES for specific details.  
         |
         | In this variable, the original L-R classifications assigned by
         | CSES Collaborators (available in IMD3100_LR_CSES and IMD5012) are
         | transformed into a three-category variable. Meanwhile, the L-R
         | classifications assigned by MARPOR/CMP in IMD3002_LR_MARPOR (and
         | originally available in IMD3100_MARPOR) are transformed into a
         | dichotomous variable. Consequently, users are advised that this
         | results in some parties/coalitions falling into different
         | categorizations on IMD3002_LR_CSES and IMD3002_LR_MARPOR.
         |
         | CSES and MARPOR/CMP have different scopes of parties/coalitions 
         | in elections and thus corresponding values assigned to
         | parties/coalitions by CSES collaborators may be unavailable in 
         | MARPOR/CMP and vice versa.

         | Data are unavailable primarily because collaborator expert 
         | judgments of parties were not provided for certain election
         | studies. Missing data for BELARUS (2001, 2008) and RUSSIA 
         | (2000, 2004) is due to most respondents reporting voting for  
         | independent candidates in the said elections, for which no
         | expert judgments are available. 
         |
         | Data are unavailable for BELGIUM-WALONIA (1999), BELARUS

         |
         | Most of the A-I parties have been scored by German collaborators

         |
         | Presidential candidates in Kyrgyzstan are competing under the
         | independent banner. Thus, no straight connections can be made
         | between parties and Presidential candidates. Since collaborators
         | provided left-right scores for parties, but Presidential
         | elections are the main election, the Kyrgyzstan (2005) study has
         | been set to missing.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (2008): IMD3002_LR_CSES
         |
         | Most of the A-I parties have been scored by New Zealand

         | IMD3002_LR_MARPOR differentiates voters who voted for a leftist/
         | rightist party/candidate of a party, based on the Manifesto
         | Research on Political Representation (MARPOR/CMP) data.
         | The variable is based on the "RILE" index. The index was
         | developed by Laver and Budge (1992). It takes 24 categories (12
         | are defined as right-wing and 12 as left-wing) and subtracts the
         | sum of all right-wing items from the sum of all left-wing items.
         | The RILE index ranges from -100 (if a party only mentions left-
         | wing issues in its program) and +100 (if a party only mentions
         | right-wing issues in its program). However, these are the 
         | theoretical maximum and minimum values, which are empirically
         | rare.
         |
         | More information about MARPOR/CMP data and the RILE index can 
         | be found at https://manifestoproject.wzb.eu/
         | (Date accessed: October 09, 2020).
         | 
         | The coding of IMD3002_LR_MARPOR is based on IMD3100_LR_MARPOR.
         | For IMD3100_LR_MARPOR, CSES linked the MARPOR/CMP data with the 
         | reported vote choice of the respondent in the main election.
         | A respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of PARTY A 
         | is assigned the value the MARPOR/CMP RILE index gives to PARTY A
         | in the said election (and so on for PARTY B, PARTY C etc...). 
         | CSES reports these values in variable IMD3100_LR_MARPOR.        
         |
         | These scores provided in IMD3100_LR_MARPOR have then been 
         | re-classified for IMD3002_LR_MARPOR to establish whether a 
         | respondent voted for a leftist/rightist party/candidate. Scores 
         | assigned by collaborators are recoded into a dichotomy as 
         | follows:

         |                    01.        0.01 - 100.0
         |
         | When a party scores 0.00 on the RILE index, that usually means
         | that there is not enough data on the dimensions available to 
         | construct a reliable RILE estimate. These cases have been set to

         | coalitions differently in elections and across polities. For         
         | example, CSES sometimes has data solely on coalitions and not 
         | the parties comprising the alliance, while MARPOR/CMP may have 
         | data concerning the individual parties in the coalition, or 
         | vice versa. Consequently, some parties may have multiple 
         | identifiers within the MARPOR/CMP dataset across time. A non          
         | comprehensive list of these deviations is noted in Part 5 of the
         | CSES IMD Codebook in POLITY NOTES.

         | DERIVATIVE VARIABLE
         |
         | IMD3002_IF_CSES details respondents' reported vote choice by the
         | ideological family of the party/candidate of the party.
         | The classification is based on CSES Collaborators experts' 
         | judgments of the party's ideological family and the respondents' 
         | reported vote choice. 
         |
         | IMD3002_IF_CSES is available for voters who reported voting for  
         | a party where expert judgments are available (i.e., for parties 
         | receiving an alphabetical classification by CSES). For more 
         | details on which parties/coalitions receive alphabetical 
         | classification see "CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION 
         | CODING - RELATIONAL DATA" in CSES IMD Codebook Part 2. 
         |         
         | IMD3002_IF_CSES differentiates voters based on the expert  
         | judgment of the CSES Collaborators on the ideological family
         | classification. The expert judgment data by party is available
         | in variable IMD5011_.  
         |
         | The coding of IMD3002_IF_CSES is based on IMD3100_IF_CSES.
         | For IMD3100_IF_CSES, CSES linked the CSES Collaborator expert 
         | judgment with the reported vote choice of the respondent in the 
         | main election. A respondent who reports voting for a party/
         | candidate of PARTY A is assigned the value the CSES Collaborator
         | gave to PARTY A in the said election on the ideological family 
         | classification (and so on for PARTY B, PARTY C etc...). 
         | CSES reports these values in variable IMD3100_IF_CSES.   
         |
         | These classifications provided in IMD3100_IF_CSES have then been 
         | re-classified for IMD3002_IF_CSES to establish an ideological 
         | family a respondent voted for. Scores assigned by collaborators 
         | are recoded as follows:

         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously, 
         | this variable reports the vote choice in the main election. 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for IMD3002_OUTGOV specifying the main election  
         | for each study in CSES for specific details.

         |
         | There is a role in Switzerland known as President of the Federal
         | Council, with the title assigned to one of the seven members
         | of the Federal Council of Switzerland, which is elected by the
         | Federal Assembly (composed of the Council of States and National
         | Council) for a four-year term. Conventionally, the role of
         | President of the Council rotates among members, depending on
         | members' seniority. The President of the Federal Council has no
         | power above the other six members of the Council, and the role is
         | largely ceremonial. The President of the Federal Council is
         | not considered the Head of State - instead, the Federal Council
         | is classified as not only the Head of State but also the Head
         | of Government. Consequently, this variable is coded

         | There is a role in Switzerland known as President of the Federal
         | Council, with the title assigned to one of the seven members
         | of the Federal Council of Switzerland, which is elected by the
         | Federal Assembly (composed of the Council of States and National
         | Council) for a four-year term. Conventionally, the role of
         | President of the Council rotates among members, depending on
         | members' seniority. The President of the Federal Council has no
         | power above the other six members of the Council, and the role is
         | largely ceremonial. The President of the Federal Council is
         | not considered the Head of State - instead, the Federal Council
         | is classified as not only the Head of State but also the Head
         | of Government. Consequently, this variable is coded
         | "9999995. NOT APPLICABLE: NO ROLE OF PRESIDENT".

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - KYRGYZSTAN (2005): IMD3004_PR_1

         | i.e., there is no straightforward connection between the
         | Presidential candidates and political parties. Hence, they are
         | labeled as independent candidates in CSES IMD.

         | For MODULES 1 and 2, the question wording for IMD3005_1 slightly 
         | deviated from the recent version applied for the CSES IMD. 
         | Specifically, MODULES 1 and 2 questionnaires asked respondents
         | whether they were close to "any particular political party".
         |
         | IMD3005_1 was intended as a filter question for IMD3005_2.
         | Only respondents who answered "YES" at IMD3005_1 should continue 
         | with IMD3005_3 (PARTY IDENTIFICATION: WHO). All other respondents
         | should continue with D3005_2 (PARTY IDENTIFICATION: DO YOU FEEL 
         | CLOSER TO ONE PARTY).
         |
         | In MODULE 1 and MODULE 2, a long and a short version of the 
         | party identification questions (Q3, Q18) were administered, 
         | depending on whether party blocks (or electoral alliances) 
         | formed for the respective election or not.
         | The LONG version of Q3/Q18 was used for respondents in systems
         | where AT LEAST ONE party block (or electoral alliance) was
         | formed. This version of the party identification question
         | prompts respondents who identify with a party block, to specify
         | which affiliated party they identify with most. 
         | The SHORT version of Q3/Q18 was to be used in polities where NO
         | party blocks (or election alliances) formed.  
         | IMD3005_1 (A3004, B3028) was administered for both versions of 
         | Q3/Q18.

         |      
         | Numerical party/alliance codes are listed in Part 3 of the CSES
         | IMD Codebook. 
         |         
         | Respondents' party mentions in IMD3005_3 depend on the two 
         | former questions (IMD3005_1 and IMD3005_2). The party mention in 
         | IMD3005_3 should have only been asked for those respondents that
         | reported to be close (IMD3005_1) or at least closer (IMD3005_2) 
         | to a party.
         | However, there are several respondents that mentioned a party
         | (IMD3005_3), without feeling close (IMD3005_1) or closer 
         | (IMD3005_2) to a party. These data remain unchanged. For further
         | details on these inconsistencies, see Standalone CSES Module
         | Codebooks. 
         |
         | In MODULES 1 and 2, respondents were asked "Which party is that?"
         | For respondents who named more than one party that they identify
         | with in MODULE 1 or MODULE 2 (SQ3a, Q18A), there was
         | a follow-up question, asking respondents to specify a single
         | party they felt closest to (SQ3b, Q18B).
         | Furthermore, MODULES 1 and 2 differentiated between respondents
         | from settings where party blocs (or electoral alliances) formed
         | for the respective election and settings in which this was not
         | the case. Respondents initially indicating they identify with a
         | party bloc or an electoral alliance (SQ3a, Q18A) received a
         | follow-up question, prompting respondents to specify
         | which affiliated party they identify with most (LQ3a(1), Q18A1).
         | For the CSES IMD, in case a respondent provided only one answer 
         | to A3005_/B3029_, this answer was adopted for IMD3005_3,
         | irrespective of whether respondents named a single party or an
         | electoral alliance. In cases respondents initially provided
         | multiple parties that they feel close to, as indicated by 
         | A3006/B3030, Q3b/Q18B was used for IMD3005_3. 
         | Finally, Q13d/Q18D was used if respondents replied NO to 
         | IMD3005_1 (Are you close to any political party) but replied 
         | YES to IMD3005_2 (Do you feel closer to one party). 
         |
         | The corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules are:

         | A3011 (Which party do you feel closer to) was a follow-up 
         | variable to A3010 (Do you feel closer to one party) according to
         | the CSES questionnaire skip pattern and should have only been
         | answered of respondents if they reported to feel closer to one
         | party than the others in A3010 ("1. YES"). However, in multiple
         | election studies, respondents who are coded as "9. MISSING" for
         | variable A3010 are also coded as "9" for variable A3010, 
         | indicating a valid party code. These respondents should have 
         | been coded as "99. MISSING" for A3011. This applies to 6,511
         | respondents from the following election studies: AUSTRALIA 1996
         | (N=346), BELGIUM-FLANDERS 1999 (N=320), CANADA 1997 (N=892),

         | SWITZERLAND 1999 (N=4), and the UNITED STATES 1996 (N=9).
         | This has been corrected in CSES IMD, and respondents were coded 
         | accordingly.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - POLAND (2001): IMD3005_3
         |
         | The original Party identification variable from CSES MODULE 2
         | for Poland (2001) study had codes 12 and 18. No party in Parties

         | IMD3006 asked respondents to place themselves on a 0-10 
         | left-right ideological scale.
         |
         | Placement of this question in successive Standalone CSES Module 
         | questionnaires varies and thus might have resulted in a small
         | deviation in the introduction to the question - please consult 
         | the Standalone CSES Module Codebooks for more information.
         |         
         | In the following, question wordings for each Module are listed.
         |
         | MODULES 1 and 2:
         | "In politics people sometimes talk of left and right. 
         | Where would you place yourself on a scale from 0 to 10
         | where 0 means the left and 10 means the right?"
         |
         | MODULES 3, 4 and 5:
         | "Where would you place yourself on this scale?"
         |         
         | In MODULE 1, respondents were first asked to place themselves 
         | on the left-right scale before placing parties on the same scale.
         | That question order was reversed for MODULES 2 to 5. 
         |
         | The CSES asks collaborators to ask the left-right
         | scale questions even if left-right is not considered to be
         | meaningful/important/widely understood in the area being
         | studied. However, it was possible to add an optional
         | alternative scale question on which respondents were asked to 
         | place parties A - I and themselves. These alternative scale 
         | questions were not harmonized for the IMD, but are available
         | in the separate MODULES 1 to 5.
         |
         | Several respondents mentioned not to know the left-right scale
         | in one of the appropriate variables on IMD3006 or IMD3007_, but
         | evaluated the other parties on even that scale. These data
         | remain unchanged. For further details on these inconsistencies, 
         | see the VARIABLE and ELECTION STUDY NOTES in the Standalone

         | MODULE 5: 
         | Question wording for CSES MODULE 5 resembles wording employed for
         | MODULES 3 and 4 for leaders A to F. However, unlike MODULES 3 and 
         | 4, MODULE 5 does not include a specification for leaders G-I.
         |    
         | Leaders and their alphabetical classifications for each country
         | are detailed in Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook. For linking
         | alphabetical to numerical party codes, please see VARIABLE NOTES

         |
         | Users should note that IMD3009_ includes several observations in 
         | which all leaders are scored equally by respondents. Also, there
         | may be instances in which respondents provide the same answer to

         |
         | IMD3009_ was not included as a regular question in the MODULE 2

         |
         | IMD3011 examines respondents external political efficacy by 
         | asking whether respondents consider who is in power makes a 
         | difference or not.
         |
         | For MODULES 1 and 2, IMD3011 had an inversed scale running from
         | "1. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHO IS IN POWER" to "5. IT DOESN'T 
         | MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHO IS IN POWER". These scales were re-coded 
         | to fit the coding of IMD3011 as outlined above.
         | For MODULES 1 and 2, therefore, question-wording reflects the 
         | inversed scale and deviated slightly from the recent version 
         | applied for the CSES IMD.     
         |
         | In MODULE 2, some election studies used an earlier version of 
         | the CSES questionnaire which included the words "BIG" and "ANY" 
         | in the question text and response options.
         |
         | For example:
         | "1. It makes a BIG difference who is in power"
         | "5. It doesn't make ANY difference who is in power"
         |
         | As a result, there has been variation in question-wording and
         | response options for IMD3011 in MODULE 2. A table documenting

         | answered "GOTTEN WORSE" at IMD3013_1 should receive this 
         | question. However, there is variation in the ways in which the
         | questions about respondent's perception of the state of economy
         | (IMD3013_1) were administered in different election studies. 
         | In some cases, the follow-up question on a worse state of economy
         | (IMD3013_3) was asked irrespectively of a respondent's answer on
         | IMD3013_1. Consequently, IMD3013_3 sometimes includes information
         | on respondents that did not mention a worse state of economy 
         | (code 5) in IMD3013_1. These data remained unchanged.
         | 
         | For CSES MODULES 5, the question wording for IMD3013_ was 
         | updated, deviating from the one outlined above. 
         | Specifically, the MODULE 5 questionnaire asked respondents to
         | rate the state of the economy on a single five-point scale, 
         | thus dropping the filter and any potential follow-up questions. 
         | The table below outlines how categories from MODULE 5 were 
         | mapped to IMD3013_3:

         | of political information. Answers to IMD3015_ are dichotomized
         | and only include respondents who explicitly answered correctly or
         | incorrectly to the respective information question. Respondents

         | not included in the incorrect answer category, unless specified
         | otherwise. 
         | 
         | The following election studies do not include a "DON'T KNOW"
         | category:

         | In CSES MODULES 1-3, most studies included up to three political 
         | information items, designed to test respondents' general 
         | knowledge. These items were designed by CSES collaborators and  
         | therefore vary across studies both in content and in difficulty. 
         | 
         | For CSES MODULES 2 and 3, the CSES questionnaire provided advice
         | to collaborators on how to assess political information, namely:
         | "These items are designed to indicate the respondents' general 
         | political knowledge. They should be coded as shown below. The
         | set of questions should include one that is easy (i.e. 2/3 will
         | answer correctly), one that is slightly more difficult (i.e. 1/2 
         | will answer correctly), and one that is difficult (i.e. 1/3 
         | will answer correctly)."
         | 
         | The question wordings of the items used in CSES MODULES 1-3, and 
         | their correct answers, are reported in the ELECTION STUDY NOTES 
         | below.
         |
         | In CSES MODULE 4, political knowledge was assessed uniformly
         | across polities, by the following four items: 
         |
         | IMD3015_1:
         |       Which of these persons was the Finance Minister before the
         |       recent election - [CABINET MINISTER NAME - FIRST CHOICE],
         |       [CABINET MINISTER NAME - SECOND CHOICE], [CABINET MINISTER
         |       NAME - THIRD CHOICE], or [CABINET MINISTER NAME - FOURTH
         |       CHOICE]?
         |
         | IMD3015_2 (FINALIZED QUESTIONNAIRE):
         |       What was the current unemployment rate in [COUNTRY] as of
         |       [DATE] - [UNEMPLOYMENT RATE - FIRST CHOICE], [UNEMPLOYMENT
         |       RATE - SECOND CHOICE], [UNEMPLOYMENT RATE - THIRD CHOICE],
         |       or [UNEMPLOYMENT RATE - FOURTH CHOICE]?
         |
         | IMD3015_2 (PILOT QUESTIONNAIRE): 
         |       What is the longest time permitted between one [UNIT OF 
         |       GOVERNMENT] election and the next - [NUMBER OF YEARS - 
         |       FIRST CHOICE], [NUMBER OF YEARS - SECOND CHOICE], 
         |       [NUMBER OF YEARS - THIRD CHOICE], or [NUMBER OF YEARS 
         |       - FOURTH CHOICE]?
         |
         | IMD3015_3:
         |       Which [PARTY, ALLIANCE, OR COALITION] came in second in
         |       seats in the [NAME OF THE LOWER HOUSE IN BICAMERAL SYSTEMS;
         |       OR ASSEMBLY, PARLIAMENT, OR CONGRESS IN UNICAMERAL SYSTEMS]
         |       - [PARTY, ALLIANCE, OR COALITION - FIRST CHOICE], [PARTY,
         |       ALLIANCE, OR COALITION - SECOND CHOICE], [PARTY, ALLIANCE,
         |       OR COALITION - THIRD CHOICE], or [PARTY, ALLIANCE, OR
         |       COALITION - FOURTH CHOICE]?
         |
         | IMD3015_4 (FINALIZED QUESTIONNAIRE):
         |       Who is the current Secretary-General of the United Nations
         |       - Kofi Annan, Kurt Waldheim, Ban Ki-moon, or Boutros
         |       Boutros-Ghali?
         | 
         | IMD3015_4 (PILOT QUESTIONNAIRE): 
         |       Who was the first President of South Africa after 
         |       apartheid ended? Desmond Tutu, Robert Mugabe, Nelson 
         |       Mandela, or Rupiah Banda?
         |
         | CANADA (2011) and IRELAND (2011) fielded the CSES MODULE 4 pilot
         | questionnaire. In the pilot version, items for IMD3015_2 and 
         | IMD3015_4 differed from the final questionnaire as indicated 
         | above. 
         |
         | As question wordings did not differ between election studies in
         | CSES MODULE 4, ELECTION STUDY NOTES only list a short description
         | of the item, together with the respective answer categories for
         | IMD3015_1 - IMD3015_3.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELGIUM-WALLONIA (1999): IMD3015_
         |
         | The Belgium Wallonia study (1999) fielded eight items assessing
         | a respondent's level of political knowledge, which are available
         | in the original French questionnaire on the CSES Homepage
         | (question 74, page 30). The CSES MODULE 1 Codebook does not 
         | include any information on which three out of those eight items
         | were selected for inclusion into CSES MODULE 1. The best guess of
         | the CSES Secretariat is that those three knowledge items were 
         | selected for CSES MODULE 1 that resemble the questions from the
         | Belgium Flanders (1999) study, namely:  
         | Question 74.1 (resembling IMD3015_1 for Belgium Flanders 1999)

         |
         | Scales in IMD3015_A - IMD3015_D indicate the number of correct 
         | answers each respondent provided to the political information 
         | items included in the Standalone CSES Modules. As political 
         | information items differed both between polities and election 
         | studies from the same polities, one separate variable for each
         | CSES Module was created.
         |
         | As the number of political information items respondents were 
         | exposed to differs between Standalone CSES Modules, two separate
         | scales were created: 
         |
         | CSES MODULES 1, 2, and 3 featured three political information 
         | items, such that the number of correct answers per respondent
         | ranges between 0 and 3. Scores on the 0-3 scale are provided 
         | in IMD3015_A (MODULE 1), IMD3015_B (MODULE 2), and IMD3015_C 
         | (MODULE 3).
         |
         | CSES MODULE 4 featured four political information items, such 
         | that the number of correct answers per respondent ranges between
         | 0 and 4. Scores on the 0-4 scale are provided in IMD3015_D.
         |
         | Some studies included fewer political information items than 
         | envisaged by the Standalone CSES Module questionnaire. IMD3015_A-
         | IMD3015_D were not calculated for respondents from these studies.
         | 
         | As CSES MODULE 5 did not feature any political information item,
         | IMD3015_ was not calculated for CSES MODULE 5. 
         | 
         | Data are unavailable for CSES MODULE 5, ARGENTINA (2015),

         | SOUTH AFRICA (2014).
         |
         | This variable is original to CSES IMD, and therefore there are

         | IMD3100_LR_CSES links the respondents' reported vote choice in

         | of the party the respondent reported voting for on the 
         | ideological left-right scale (0-10). 
         |
         | IMD3100_LR_CSES is available for voters who reported voting for a 
         | party where expert judgments are available (i.e., for parties 
         | receiving an alphabetical classification by CSES). For more 
         | details on which parties/coalitions receive alphabetical 
         | classification see "CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION 
         | CODING - RELATIONAL DATA" in CSES IMD Codebook Part 2. 
         |
         | IMD3100_LR_CSES assigns respondents a score based on respondent 
         | reported vote choice and the corresponding expert judgment 
         | of the CSES Collaborators on the left-right ideology scale for 
         | the party the respondent reports voting for.        
         | Collaborators assign parties scores on an 11-point scale ranging
         | from "0. LEFT" to "10. RIGHT" for all parties assigned an 
         | alphabetical code by CSES. The expert judgment data by party 
         | is available in variable IMD5012_.
         |
         | Some parties/coalitions have scores that are not round numbers,
         | e.g., 1.5 or 3.5. These scores can reflect collaborator
         | judgments or reflect the classification of a coalition. 
         | Sometimes respondents report voting for a coalition, but
         | collaborators score parties that comprise this coalition
         | separately on the L-R scale. The score used for IMD3100_LR_CSES
         | is the mean of L-R scores of parties that comprise the given
         | coalition. 
         | All of these instances are detailed in ELECTION STUDY NOTES 
         | below.        
         |
         | IMD3100_LR_CSES links the CSES Collaborator expert judgment with  
         | the reported vote of the respondent in the main election. Here, 
         | a respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of PARTY A
         | is assigned the value the CSES Collaborator gave to PARTY A in 
         | the said election on the left-right scale (and so on for PARTY B, 
         | PARTY C, etc...). 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in

         |
         | In 1998, German collaborators assigned the following L-R scores
         | - Christian Democratic Party (L-R score = 6)
         | - Christian Social Union in Bavaria (L-R score = 7)
         | Thus, the score for the Union in 1998 for IMD3100_LR_CSES is

         | Thus, the score for the Union in 1998 for IMD3100_LR_CSES is
         | 7.5.
         |
         | In 2009, German collaborators assigned the following L-R scores
         | - Christian Democratic Party (L-R score = 5)
         | - Christian Social Union in Bavaria (L-R score = 5)
         | Thus, the score for the Union in 1998 for IMD3100_LR_CSES is
         | 5.
         |
         | In 2013, German collaborators assigned the following L-R scores
         | - Christian Democratic Party (L-R score = 6)
         | - Christian Social Union in Bavaria (L-R score = 7)
         | Thus, the score for the Union in 1998 for IMD3100_LR_CSES is

         | IMD3100_LR_MARPOR links the respondents' reported vote choice in 
         | the main election with the MARPOR/CMP "RILE" index assigned to 
         | the party the respondent reported voting for based on the 
         | manifesto the party contested the election on. 
         |

         | classification see "CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION 
         | CODING - RELATIONAL DATA" in CSES IMD Codebook Part 2. 
         |
         | IMD3100_LR_MARPOR assigns respondents a score based on respondent 
         | reported vote choice and the corresponding value of that party 
         | on the MARPOR "rile" index. This index was developed by Laver
         | and Budge (1992). It takes 24 categories (12 are defined as
         | right-wing and 12 as left-wing) and subtracts the sum of all
         | right-wing items from the sum of all left-wing items.
         | The rile index ranges from -100 (if a party only mentions left
         | wing issues in its program) and +100 (if a party only talks
         | about right-wing issues). However, these are only theoretical
         | maximum and minimum, which are empirically very rare,
         | as most parties talk about both - left and right issues.
         |
         | IMD3100_LR_MARPOR links the MARPOR "rile" index value with the  
         | reported vote of the respondent in the main election. Here, a
         | respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of PARTY A
         | is assigned the value MARPOR "rile" index gave to PARTY A in
         | the said election (and so on for PARTY B, PARTY C etc...). 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for IMD3002_OUTGOV specifying the main election 
         | for each study in CSES for specific details.

         |
         | Users are advised that CSES and MARPOR/CMP sometimes classify          
         | coalitions differently in elections and across polities. For         
         | example, CSES sometimes has data solely on coalitions and not 
         | the parties comprising the alliance, while MARPOR/CMP may have 
         | data concerning the individual parties in the coalition, or 
         | vice versa. Consequently, some parties may have multiple 
         | identifiers within the MARPOR/CMP dataset across time. A non          
         | comprehensive list of these deviations is noted in Part 5  
         | of the CSES IMD Codebook in POLITY NOTES.

         | Users are advised that the same party might have been coded as 
         | belonging to different party families across different
         | elections. These differences may reflect actual changes in
         | parties' ideological positions across time.

         | experts on which ideological family the respective party 
         | belongs to, whenever national collaborators changed between 
         | election studies. The list of all parties whose assigned

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD5000_
         |
         | In the Standalone CSES Modules, parties A through F are the six 
         | most popular parties/coalitions, ordered in descending order of
         | their share of the popular vote in the parliamentary election 
         | (unless otherwise stated). Parties G, H, and I are supplemental
         | parties. They may, but do not have to, accord with how parties
         | A-F are ordered and often reflect important or notable parties
         | within a country or members of party coalitions. 
         | For the CSES IMD, this alphabetical structure was maintained, 
         | meaning that alphabetical codes assigned to parties/coalitions
         | and leaders in Standalone CSES Modules were not changed. Rather, 
         | IMD5000_ serves as an identifier in the dataset, providing 
         | the unique and unambiguous numerical party codes listed in 
         | Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook. As codes in IMD5000_ are  
         | labeled with the corresponding party names, they allow 
         | easy identification of the relational data within the dataset. 
         |
         | For the CSES IMD dataset, alphabetical codes are used to 
         | identify the following:
         | - Respondent's likability of the party/coalition 
         |   (variable IMD3008_). 
         | - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition 
         |   (variable IMD3007_).
         | - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition 
         |   in lower house (variable IMD5001_)
         | - Election Results: percentage of seats for each party/coalition 
         |   in lower house (variable IMD5002_)
         | - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition 
         |   in upper house (variable IMD5003_)
         | - Election Results: percentage of seats for each party/coalition 
         |   in upper house (variable IMD5004_)
         | - Election Results: percentage of vote for each party/coalition 
         |   in Presidential election (variable IMD5005_)
         | - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said 
         |   party/coalition's ideological family placement 
         |   (variable IMD5011_).
         | - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the 
         |   said party/coalition's left-right placement (variable 
         |   IMD5012).
         | - Number of cabinet portfolios held by each party/coalition 
         |   before the election (variable IMD5029_).
         | - Number of cabinet portfolios held by each party/coalition after
         |   the election (variable IMD5031_).  
         | - Manifesto research on political representation identifier
         |   for each party/coalition (variable IMD5100_).
         | - Parliaments and Governments (ParlGov) identifier for each
         |   party/coalition (variable IMD5101_).
         | - The said party/coalition's Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) 
         |   Identifier (variable IMD5102_).
         | - The said party/coalition's Party Facts Identifier 
         |   (variable IMD5103_).   
         | 
         | In most cases, the alphabetical party codes correspond to the
         | alphabetical code for the leader of that same party (e.g., 
         | LEADER A is the leader of PARTY A). However, there are 
         | exceptions, such as in instances in which data is available for
         | two leaders of the same party (e.g., Ireland 2011 in CSES MODULE
         | 4). For more detailed information on how CSES codes parties/
         | coalitions and leaders, please see Parts 3 and 4 of the CSES IMD
         | Codebook.

         | of the Federal Council of Switzerland, which is elected by the

         | members' seniority. The President of the Federal Council has no
         | power above the other six members of the Council, and the role is
         | largely ceremonial. The President of the Federal Council is
         | not considered the Head of State - instead, the Federal Council

         | of Government. Consequently, these variables are coded

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD5006_2
         | 
         | IMD5006_2 details the Voting Age Population (VAP) turnout, which
         | includes all citizens above the legal voting age in a country. 
         | It is not intended to be a precise measure of the number of 
         | citizens entitled to vote as it does not take into account legal
         | or systematic impediments such as resident non-citizens. Rather,
         | its intent is to provide an estimate of turnout besides estimates
         | based solely on an electoral register. Voter registers are often
         | outdated or inaccurate or in some circumstances are not used for
         | elections (e.g., 1994 South African elections).         
         |
         | In some polities, voters are registered automatically and hence
         | it might be expected that the electoral register measure and the
         | voting age population would be identical. This is not always the
         | case for the reasons set out above. However, and unless we can
         | verify accuracy, CSES reports the voting age population as 
         | listed by the IDEA. However, ELECTION STUDY NOTES, available in
         | Part 2 of the Codebooks for the respective Standalone CSES 
         | Modules, do alert users to instances where voter registration
         | is automatic and thus to cases for which in theory the ER 
         | and VAP estimates could be identical.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (2009): IMD5007
         |
         | Contrary to CHILE 1999 and CHILE 2005, respondents were coded
         | as "3. YES; WITHOUT SANCTION FOR VIOLATION" instead of "2. YES;
         | WEAKLY ENFORCED SANCTIONS." The reasons were changes which 
         | included a switch from a system of voluntary registration and 
         | mandatory voting to automated registration and voluntary voting.

         | POLITY NOTES - RUSSIA: IMD5008_1
         | 
         | Vladimir Putin was Russia's Prime Minister (formally: "Chairman 
         | of the Government of the Russian Federation"), before the Russian
         | 1999 parliamentary election and the 2000 Presidential election.    
         | Although Putin was formally independent, he supported Unity 
         | (IMD numeric party code 6430051) at the 1999 election and was
         | backed by Unity after that election. 
         | Therefore, in his role as Prime Minister, Putin is coded as 
         | being affiliated with Unity.
         | However, additionally to his role as incumbent Prime Minister, 
         | Putin became acting President of Russia, after Boris Yeltsin's
         | resignation on December 31, 1999 - resulting in early 
         | Presidential elections on March 26, 2000 (see POLITY NOTES on 
         | IMD5009_ for more information). 
         | After Putin was confirmed as President, Mikhail Kasyanov became
         | Prime Minister, who was independent at that time.

         | There is no formal Prime Minister in Switzerland. Instead,

         | Federal Council of Switzerland. This organism has seven members
         | and is elected by the Federal Assembly (which is composed of two
         | organs, the Council of States and National Council) for a 
         | four-year term. Since 1959, the Federal Council has been composed
         | of a coalition of all major parties (SVP/UDC, SP/PS, FDP/PRD, 
         | and CVP/PDC), an arrangement called the "magic formula". The 
         | Council elects each year among its members a President, but this
         | position is presumably largely ceremonial. Consequently, this 
         | variable is coded with 9999997 "Not applicable".

         | Presidential candidate for the Socialist Party (PS). After Jospin
         | missed the second round, he resigned from politics.
         | Jean-Pierre Raffarin became Prime Minister after the 2002 
         | Presidential election. By that time, Raffarin was still a member 
         | of Liberal Democracy, a party that officially merged into the 
         | Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) in November 2002. Therefore, 
         | Raffarin is coded as belonging to the UMP for IMD5008_2.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD5008_C
         |
         | IMD5008_C details whether the party of the Prime Minister changed
         | throughout the course of the election for studies covering a 
         | lower house election. 
         |
         | IMD5008_C is constructed based on the party of the Prime Minister 
         | before and after the election, as coded in variables IMD5008_1 
         | and IMD5008_2, respectively. Hence, researchers are advised that 
         | IMD5008_C disregards changes or continuities in personalities, 
         | focusing on the party brand instead.
         |
         | Studies are classified as "0. PARTY OF THE PRIME MINISTER 
         | DID NOT CHANGE AFTER ELECTION" if there was a lower house 
         | election, IMD5008_1 and IMD5008_2 detail the same party of the 
         | Prime Minister before and after the election, or Prime Ministers
         | were both coded as being "9999989. INDEPENDENT" in IMD5008_1 and
         | IMD5008_2. 
         |
         | Studies are classified as "1. PARTY OF THE PRIME MINISTER CHANGED
         | AFTER ELECTION" if there was a lower house election and IMD5008_1
         | and IMD5008_2 detail different party affiliations of the Prime 
         | Minister before and after the election in IMD5008_. 
         |
         | Although IMD5008_1 and IMD5008_2 detail the party of the Prime 
         | Minister regardless of whether there was a lower house election,
         | IMD5008_C codes studies in which no lower house election took 
         | place as "6. NOT APPLICABLE: NO LOWER HOUSE ELECTION". The 
         | rationale for this coding decision is that most Prime Ministers
         | in CSES polities are accountable to parliament, meaning that 
         | changes in Prime Ministership are expected to occur primarily
         | when the composition of parliament changes. 
         | Instances in which the party of the Prime Minister changed 
         | although no lower house election was held are listed in ELECTION
         | STUDY NOTES below.
         |
         | Code "7. NOT APPLICABLE: NO ROLE OF PRIME MINISTER" denotes 
         | polities for which the role of the Prime Minister does not exist,
         | oftentimes because the executive power in government is exercised
         | by the Presidency or a collective organism (e.g., Switzerland).
         |
         | This variable is original to CSES IMD, and therefore there are 
         | no corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.

         | POLITY NOTES - FRANCE: IMD5008_C
         |
         | Although the French 2002, 2012, and 2017 election studies refer 
         | exclusively to the respective Presidential elections, these 
         | contests also involved a change in the Prime Minister's party 
         | shortly after the elections.
         | The Prime Minister of France is appointed by the French 
         | President. However, as the Prime Minister is accountable to the
         | French lower house, the National Assembly, the choice requires a
         | parliamentary majority in practice. Conventionally, French 
         | legislative elections closely follow the Presidential contests 
         | since 2002 to decrease the chances of a divided government.
         |
         | After having lost the Presidential election in 2002 to Jacques
         | Chirac (Union for a Popular Movement, UMP), incumbent Prime 
         | Minister Lionel Jospin (Socialist Party, PS) retired. He was 
         | succeeded in office by Jean-Pierre Raffarin (UMP), whose party
         | obtained a parliamentary majority after the June 2002 legislative
         | election. 
         |
         | In 2012, incumbent President Nicolas Sarkozy (UMP) lost the 
         | election to Francois Hollande (PS). Upon assuming office, 
         | Hollande appointed Jean-Marc Ayrault (PS) as Prime Minister. 
         | Ayrault succeeded Francois Fillon (UMP) in office, who resigned
         | following UMP's defeat in the Presidential contest. The PS also 
         | became the strongest party after the June 2012 legislative
         | elections, thereby backing Ayrault in parliament.
         |
         | In 2017, incumbent President Francois Hollande (PS) lost the 
         | election to Emmanuel Macron (LaREM). Upon assuming office, Macron
         | appointed Edouard Philippe as Prime Minister (The Republicans, 
         | LR). Philippe succeeded Bernard Cazeneuve (PS) in office, who 
         | resigned following PS's defeat in the Presidential contest. 
         | LaREM also obtained a parliamentary majority after the June 2017

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - KENYA (2013): IMD5008_C
         |
         | The office of the Prime Minister of Kenya briefly existed from 
         | 1963-1964, but was temporarily re-established in 2008, as part of 
         | a power-sharing agreement between incumbent President Mwai Kibaki
         | and opposition leader Raila Odinga (Orange Democratic Movement), 
         | with Odinga becoming Prime Minister in 2008. Following the 
         | new Constitution adopted in a 2010 referendum, the post of the 
         | Prime Minister was abolished after the 2013 elections. Hence, 
         | IMD5008_C is coded "9. MISSING" for Kenya 2013.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - KYRGYZSTAN (2005): IMD5008_C
         |
         | The Kyrgyz 2005 election study focuses on the Presidential 
         | contest, held on July 10, 2005. Presidential elections followed 
         | events earlier that year culminating in the "Tulip Revolution" 
         | that saw incumbent President Askar Akayev flee the country on 
         | March 24, 2005, after widespread public protests. In Akayev's
         | absence, Kurmanbek Bakiyev (formally an independent) acted as 
         | both Prime Minister and President, being confirmed as President
         | in the July election. Upon seizing the Presidency, Bakiyev 
         | appointed Felix Kulkov (Ar-Namys) as Prime Minister, who was 
         | confirmed in office by the parliament on September 1, 2005. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - RUSSIA (2000): IMD5008_C
         |
         | The Russian 2000 election study refers to the Presidential 
         | elections, held on March 26, 2000. At the time, Vladimir Putin 
         | was both incumbent Prime Minister (formally: "Chairman of the 
         | Government of the Russian Federation"), and acting President 
         | following Boris Yeltsin's resignation on December 31, 1999.  
         | Although Putin was formally independent, he supported Unity 
         | at the 1999 legislative election and was backed by Unity 
         | afterward. Therefore, in his role as Prime Minister, Putin is 
         | coded as being affiliated with Unity. After Putin was confirmed 
         | as President in the 2000 contest, Mikhail Kasyanov became Prime 
         | Minister, who was independent at that time.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TAIWAN (2008): IMD5008_C
         |
         | Taiwan's head of government, known as the Premier of the Republic
         | of China or the President of the Executive Yuan, is appointed by
         | the President without requiring approval of Taiwan's parliament. 
         | In the 2008 Taiwanese Presidential election, incumbent President
         | Chen Shui-bian (Democratic Progressive Party, DPP) was ineligible
         | to re-election due to term limits. The DPP's candidate lost the 
         | election to Kuomintang's candidate, Ma Ying-jeou. Upon assuming 
         | Presidency, Ma appointed Liu Chao-shiuan (Kuomintang) as Premier,
         | who succeeded Chang Chun-hsiung (DPP) in office. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TURKEY (2018): IMD5008_C
         |
         | Constitutional amendments approved in a 2017 referendum turned  
         | the Turkish Presidency into an executive post, effective with the
         | 2018 general election. Consequentially, the office of the Prime 
         | Minister, held by incumbent Binali Yildirim (AKP), was abolished
         | after the 2018 electoral contest. Hence, IMD5008_C is coded
         | "9. MISSING" for Turkey 2018.

         | 
         | Before and after the 1999 Russian parliamentary election, Boris
         | Yeltsin (independent) was the President of Russia. 
         | However, Yeltsin resigned from office on December 31, 1999,

         | Incumbent Prime Minister Vladimir Putin became acting President
         | and won the 2000 and 2004 Presidential elections as an 
         | independent candidate (IMD Code 6430101). 
         | In his role as Prime Minister, Putin supported and was backed

         | power above the other six members of the Council, and the role is
         | largely ceremonial. The President of the Federal Council is
         | not considered the Head of State - instead, the Federal Council
         | is classified as not only the Head of State but also the Head

         | The Bulgarian President before and after the 2001 parliamentary
         | election was Petar Stoyanov, a member of the Union of Democratic 
         | Forces (SDS). Therefore, both IMD5009_ variables were coded as

         | elections, held on April 21 (first round) and May 5, 2002 (second
         | round). Incumbent President Jacques Chirac was re-elected as a
         | member of Rally for the Republic (RPR, IMD numeric party code 
         | 2500008). 
         | However, in preparation for the legislative election, which took

         | created the "Union for the Presidential Majority", to contest 
         | the legislative election jointly with several other center-right
         | parties. This alliance formally turned into the Union for a 
         | Popular Movement (UMP) later the same year. Therefore, for

              7. NOT APPLICABLE: NO ROLE OF PRESIDENT

              9. MISSING


         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD5009_C
         |
         | IMD5009_C details whether the party of the President changed
         | throughout the course of the election for studies covering a 
         | Presidential election. 
         |
         | IMD5009_C is constructed based on the party of the President 
         | before and after the election, as coded in variables IMD5009_1 
         | and IMD5009_2, respectively. Hence, researchers are advised that 
         | IMD5009_C disregards changes or continuities in personalities, 
         | focusing on the President's party brand instead. 
         | For example, in the 2006 Mexican general election, the National 
         | Action Party (PAN) managed to retain the Presidency, although the
         | incumbent changed from Vicente Fox to Felipe Calderon, as 
         | Presidents in Mexico are not eligible to seek re-election. As
         | IMD5009_C focuses on the party, it is coded "0. PARTY OF THE 
         | PRESIDENT DID NOT CHANGE AFTER ELECTION" for Mexico 2006 and all
         | similar instances.
         | 
         | Studies are classified as "0. PARTY OF THE PRESIDENT DIT NOT 
         | CHANGE AFTER ELECTION" if there was a Presidential election, 
         | IMD5009_1 and IMD5009_2 detail the same party of the President 
         | before and after the election, or Presidents were both coded as
         | being "9999989. INDEPENDENT" in IMD5009_1 and IMD5009_2. 
         |
         | Studies are classified as "1. PARTY OF THE PRESIDENT CHANGED 
         | AFTER ELECTION" if there was a Presidential election and 
         | IMD5009_1 and IMD5009_2 detail different party affiliations of 
         | the President before and after the election.
         |
         | Although IMD5009_1 and IMD5009_2 detail the party of the 
         | President regardless of whether there was a Presidential 
         | election, IMD5009_C codes studies in which no Presidential 
         | election took place as "6. NOT APPLICABLE: NO PRESIDENTIAL 
         | ELECTION". The rationale for this coding decision is that shifts
         | in the Presidents' party affiliations are expected to coincide
         | with elections primarily if Presidents are directly elected. 
         | Instances in which the party of the President changed although
         | no direct Presidential election was held are listed in ELECTION
         | STUDY NOTES below.
         |
         | Code "7. NOT APPLICABLE: NO ROLE OF PRESIDENT" denotes polities
         | for which the role of the President does not exist, as is the 
         | case e.g. in constitutional monarchies embracing parliamentary 
         | systems.
         |
         | This variable is original to CSES IMD, and therefore there are 
         | no corresponding variables in the Standalone CSES Modules.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREECE (2015 Jan): IMD5009_C
         |
         | Conventionally, the President of Greece is elected indirectly by
         | the country's unicameral legislature. However, if parliament 
         | fails to elect a candidate after three rounds by a supermajority
         | of either 66 (first two rounds) or 60 percent (third round), the
         | parliament is to be dissolved within ten days, resulting in snap 
         | elections. 
         | Such an instance occurred at the Greek 2014/2015 Presidential 
         | election, in which the candidate nominated by the government 
         | coalition of New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist 
         | Movement (PASOK), Stavros Dimas, failed to obtain the required 
         | parliamentary majority in the first three rounds scheduled on 
         | December 17, 23, and 29, 2014. Subsequent legislative snap 
         | elections were held on January 25, 2015, resulting in a coalition
         | between SYRIZA and the Independent Greeks (ANEL) headed by Prime
         | Minister Alexis Tsipras (SYRIZA). Tsipras nominated Prokopios

         | IMD5011_ details the expert judgment of the national
         | collaborators as to which ideological family each party belongs
         | to. Often, collaborators provide two characterizations for a 
         | party. These multiple characterizations, together with details 
         | of what characterization is coded in the dataset, are detailed  
         | in the ELECTION STUDY NOTES, available in the Codebook Parts 2 
         | of the Standalone CSES Modules.
         |
         | Collaborators at times provide additional information to help
         | refine the characterization, and when applicable, these are
         | detailed in the ELECTION STUDY NOTES, available in the Codebook 
         | Parts 2 of the Standalone CSES Modules.

         | Users are advised that the same party might have been coded as 
         | belonging to different party families across different elections.
         | These differences may reflect actual changes in parties' 
         | ideological positions across time. 
         | Alternatively, they might reflect disagreement on different 
         | experts on which ideological family the respective party 
         | belongs to, whenever national collaborators changed between 
         | election studies.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] MODULE 1  - IMD5011_
         |
         | In CSES MODULE 1, several election studies were coded "NOT 
         | APPLICABLE" for those IMD5011_ variables for which no alphabetic
         | party code was assigned. In CSES IMD, the following variables 
         | were recoded from "NOT APPLICABLE" to "99. MISSING":
         | IMD5011_D and IMD5011_E were recoded to "99. MISSING" for Taiwan
         | (1996) and United States (1996). 
         | IMD5011_F was recoded to "99. MISSING" for Australia (1996), 
         | Canada (1997), Great Britain (1997), Iceland (1999), Israel 
         | (1996), Lithuania (1997), Taiwan (1996) and United States (1996).

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - SPAIN (2000): IMD5011_F
         |
         | In CSES MODULE 1, variable A5002_F is assigned code "13. REGIONAL
         | PARTIES". However, it could not be ascertained what party the 
         | rating refers to, as only parties A-E are specified for Spain 
         | (2000). Consequently, IMD5011_F was recoded to "99. MISSING"
         | for CSES IMD.

         |
         | Parties numerical classifications are detailed in Part 3 of the 
         | CSES IMD Codebook. Alphabetical party and leader codes are 
         | identified in Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook.         
         | For linking alphabetical to numerical party codes, please see 
         | VARIABLE NOTES on IMD5000_.  
         | For more detailed information on how CSES codes parties/
         | coalitions and leaders, please see Parts 3 and 4 of the CSES IMD 
         | Codebook. 
         |          
         | IMD5012_ details the expert judgment of the national 
         | collaborators as to where parties are located on the left-right
         | ideological scale. Sometimes, parties' ideological differences in 
         | certain polities on the left-right scale are difficult to 
         | detect, perhaps because party competition is not structured on  
         | the left-right dimension. These instances are detailed in  
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES, available in Codebook Parts 2 of the 
         | respective CSES MODULES. Moreover, Standalone CSES Modules 
         | include variables covering an alternative expert judgment scale
         | based on national collaborators' ratings of parties on a scale of
         | their choice, which is related to relevant national political
         | circumstances. These alternative scale ratings were not
         | harmonized for the IMD, but are available in the separate
         | MODULES 2 to 5.

         |
         | IMD5013 details whether the country uses (i) a majoritarian 
         | formula in all of its electoral segments (tiers), (ii) a 
         | proportional formula in all of its electoral segments (tiers), 
         | or (iii) a mixed formula.
         |
         | The definition of this variable is taken from Matt Golder's
         | database about Democratic Electoral Systems Around the World,
         | 1946-2000 (http://mattgolder.com/elections, Date accessed: May 
         | 17, 2018).
         |
         | MAJORITARIAN systems require successful candidates to win either
         | a plurality or majority of the vote. As a result, they are
         | considered majoritarian.
         |
         | PROPORTIONAL systems can be divided into two types: those that 
         | use party lists and those like the single transferable vote that 
         | do not. Those systems employing lists can themselves be divided 
         | into two further categories: quota systems (with allocation of
         | remainders) and highest average systems.
         |
         | MIXED systems use a mixture of majoritarian and proportional
         | electoral rules. A country can be classified as having a mixed
         | system whether it uses one or more electoral segments (tiers); in
         | practice, most mixed systems have more than one segment (tier).
         | Mixed electoral systems can be divided into those in which the
         | two electoral formulas are dependent and those in which they are
         | independent.

         | IMD5014 details the electoral formula used to elect the President
         | when the President is elected by popular vote. Presidents 
         | indirectly elected (for example, those elected by Parliament) are 
         | classified as "7. NOT APPLICABLE".

         | Source of data: Publicly Available Sources.
         |
         | Below, the classifications of each electoral formula are 
         | summarized: 
         |    
         | PLURALITY - the candidate that obtains the most votes wins.
         |
         | ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE - A candidate must win over 50% of the
         | vote to win. If no candidate wins this many votes, then there is
         | a runoff between the top two candidates.
         |
         | QUALIFIED MAJORITY RULE - Each qualified majority system 
         | specifies a particular percentage of the vote that a candidate 
         | must win in order to be elected in the first round. If two or 
         | more candidates overcome these thresholds, then the one with the 
         | highest number of votes wins. The qualified majority systems vary 
         | in terms of the electoral procedure that applies when these 
         | thresholds are not met.
         |
         | ELECTORAL COLLEGE - The candidate that wins a plurality of the
         | electoral college votes wins.
         |
         | SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE - Requires voters to rank single
         | candidates in order of the most to least preferred. Votes are
         | transferred until candidates obtain the Droop quota. The
         | candidate that obtains this quota first is elected.
         |
         | The definition of this variable is taken from Matt Golder's

         | IMD5014 is a system variable, meaning that it is measured at the 
         | polity level. Consequently, the variable is coded for a polity
         | even though a Presidential election may not have taken place 
         | (e.g., Mexico 2003).

         | POLITY NOTES - AUSTRALIA: IMD5016_
         |
         | For lower house elections, Australia employs the Alternative
         | Vote system. In this system, voters are required to list their
         | preferences for as many candidates as there are on the ballot. 
         | Thus, the total number of votes varies across electoral 
         | districts.
         |
         | For upper house elections, Australia employs a single-
         | transferable-vote form of proportional representation. In this
         | system each voter indicates the order of preference among all
         | the candidates in competing in her district, or alternatively,
         | she can indicate support for a party ticket (which determines
         | the order of preference of candidates within the party).

         | [POLITY NOTES] - BELGIUM: IMD5016_3 - IMD5016_4
         |
         | Previously, the process of electing Senators in Belgium was a
         | mixture, some were indirectly elected, and 40 Senators were
         | directly elected (25 in Flanders, 15 in Wallonia). For these
         | elections voters used to cast one vote (one-tier system). That
         | is why all three Belgium studies have been coded "97. Not
         | applicable" for the variable IMD5016_4 in CSES IMD.
         | The law changed in 2014, and Senators in Belgium are not directly
         | elected anymore.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - BRAZIL: IMD5016_3
         |
         | Members of the Brazilian Senate (Senado Federal) are elected
         | for an 8-year term. The chamber is composed of 81 members, 
         | with each state in Brazil having three Senators each. 
         | Members are elected in alternative electoral cycles: Two-thirds 
         | of the Senate seats (n=54) are contested in one election cycle 
         | while the remaining one-third are contested in the other.
         | In 2002 and 2010, two-thirds of the Senate were renewed, giving
         | voters two votes in these upper house elections.	 
         | The 2006 and 2014 elections saw a third of the Senate seats
         | contested (n=27). Accordingly, voters therefore had one vote in
         | these elections as only one Senator per State was being
         | selected.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - CZECH REPUBLIC/CZECHIA: IMD5016_3
         |
         | Czech (1996, 2002) studies have been coded "97. Not applicable" 
         | because these studies do not refer to Upper House elections.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - DENMARK: IMD5016_1 & IMD5016_2
         |
         | The Danish Folketing has 179 members, 175 of which are elected
         | in mainland Denmark and the remaining four from the territories
         | of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. In mainland Denmark, 135 
         | members are elected from ten multi-member constituencies across
         | three geographical regions, namely: Copenhagen, Northern Jutland, 
         | and Seeland-Southern Denmark. Additionally, 40 supplementary 
         | seats are distributed across these three geographical regions  
         | in order to achieve full proportionality.  While voters do not 
         | cast a ballot directly for this tier, it is widely  
         | acknowledged to constitute a separate tier of the electoral 
         | system.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - HONG KONG: IMD5016_
         |
         | Hong Kong adopted a constitutional reform package in 2010, which
         | also affected the election law. Reforms increased the size of
         | the unicameral Legislative Council of the HKSAR to 70 members.
         | Half of the legislative council is returned by geographic
         | constituency (popular) elections; the other half is returned by
         | functional constituency elections.
         | Election data on Hong Kong electoral institutions refer to the 
         | geographical constituency elections only.
         | In the Geographical Constituency (GC) part of the Election, Hong
         | Kong is divided into five constituencies, and voters elect 
         | candidates by universal suffrage. The number of LegCo seats in 
         | each constituency is decided according to the constituency 
         | population. The voting system adopted is the closed list 
         | proportional representation system. Geographical Constituency is
         | treated here as the first segment of the LegCo.
         | There are two parts of the Functional Constituencies (FCs): the 
         | traditional FCs and the District Council (Second) FC.
         | The traditional FCs return 30 LegCo members. Registration as a 
         | voter in some traditional Fcs requires certain qualifications, 
         | for example, registered medical practitioners or dentists for 
         | the Medical FC. Note that in some FCs, voters are individuals, 
         | while in others, 'voters' are not individuals but companies or 
         | organizations.
         | The District Council (Second) FC was created in 2012 and is 
         | treated here as the second segment of the LegCo. This segment 
         | returns five LegCo members. In this part of the election, the  
         | whole of Hong Kong has one constituency only, and the voting 
         | system adopted is closed-list proportional representation. 
         | Candidates must be elected District Council members who are  
         | nominated by no less than 15 other elected District Council  
         | members, whereas voters are registered GC electors who are not 
         | registered in other FCs.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - MEXICO: IMD5016_1 - IMD5016_2
         |
         | Mexican voters cast a single vote in a single-member district
         | plurality election. However, this also counts for the allocation
         | of the proportional representation seats disputed in the larger
         | regional multi-member districts (five circumscriptions). Thus,
         | voters are not allowed to split their vote, in fact, the same
         | vote is subject to a double-counting that produces two-seat
         | relevant vote totals. The first vote total determines who wins
         | the plurality in the single-member district (300 seats). The
         | second serves to allocate seats in the multi-member districts
         | (200 seats). The PR seats are allocated according to the
         | aggregate distribution of votes of multi-member districts.
         | For a party to be entitled to have members of proportional
         | representation in the Lower Chamber, it must attain at
         | least 2% of the total votes cast for these elections.
         |
         | Since voters in Mexico cast a single vote, all Mexican studies
         | have been coded "97. Not applicable" for variable IMD5016_2.
         | This is a change in IMD compared with CSES Standalone Modules.
         | The change applies to the Mexican 1997 and 2000 studies.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NETHERLANDS: IMD5016_3 - IMD5016_4
         |
         | Members of the Senate (Eerste Kamer) of the Dutch Parliament
         | (the States General) are elected indirectly - by the members
         | of the twelve Provincial Councils. Thus, coding for the Dutch
         | 1998 and 2002 studies is set to "97, Not applicable", which is
         | not the case in the Standalone Modules.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NORWAY: IMD5016_
         |
         | The Norwegian Parliament comprises 169 seats in two tiers:
         | 150 members are elected in 19 multi-member districts using
         | proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats are
         | compensatory and are allocated to parties that receive 4%+ of
         | the national vote. These seats are known as "members at large"
         | and are seen as a means of evening out discrepancies between
         | the number of votes received and the number of seats in the
         | Storting. The distribution is based on a comparison of the
         | actual distribution of seats with what would have occurred
         | had the country been treated as one big constituency, thus
         | allowing a determination to be made as to which parties are
         | under-represented. These parties are then awarded "seats at
         | large" in the constituencies where they were closest to winning
         | an ordinary seat. While voters do not cast a ballot directly for
         | this tier and the seats are awarded at the national level
         | (albeit dispersed at the constituency level), it is widely 
         | acknowledged to constitute a separate tier of the electoral 
         | system.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - PHILIPPINES: IMD5016_3
         |
         | The Philippines Senate (Senado) has 24 members, serving six-
         | years terms. Concurrently with Presidential elections, half
         | of the Senate (12 members) is renewed every three years, in a
         | single nationwide constituency. Senators are elected
         | according to the simple majority, and each voter can cast
         | up to 12 votes. Hence, vote percentages and national totals
         | are not meaningful figures.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - POLAND: IMD5016_2
         |
         | A constitutional reform in 1997 and the changed divisions of 1999
         | required a reform of the electoral system. The system changed 
         | before the 2001 elections, seeing the final liquidation of the 
         | party list system where some MPs were elected based on nationwide
         | support and some based on the support from local constituencies.
         | This changed in the above-mentioned reform, and Polish citizens,
         | in the subsequent Parliamentary elections covered by CSES 
         | (2001-2011), cast a single vote.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - POLAND: IMD5016_3
         |
         | In Senate elections, voters have as many votes as there are
         | candidates to be elected in a district (between one and four).
         | Thus, all Poland studies have been coded "91. OTHER [SEE
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES]" for IMD5016_3. Coding has changed for the
         | following Polish studies: 1997, 2005, 2007, and 2011.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SLOVENIA: IMD5016_2
         |
         | Voters in Slovenia cast a single vote in an open list 
         | proportional system, a one-tier system. Since there has not been
         | a change of rules across elections covered by CSES, the Slovenian
         | 1996 and 2004 studies are coded "97. Not applicable" for the 
         | CSES IMD.

         | 
         | The Senate consists of 208 directly elected seats and 56 
         | indirectly elected seats. This section refers to the directly 
         | elected section. There are 52 multi-member constituencies 
         | corresponding to the country's provinces, plus Ceuta and Melilla.
         | The provinces elect four Senators each. In the case of insular 
         | provinces, major islands elect three Senators each, while small 
         | islands elect one Senator each. The autonomous cities of Ceuta

         | Thus, the Spanish 1996, 2004, and 2004 studies have been recoded 
         | to "3" for IMD5016_3.

         |
         | The Swedish Riksdag has 349 members, where 310 members are
         | elected from 29 multi-member constituencies. Additionally, 
         | 39 supplementary seats are distributed in order to achieve full
         | proportionality, which are equivalent to a second tier. While 
         | voters do not cast a ballot directly for this tier, it is widely  
         | acknowledged to constitute a separate tier of the electoral 
         | system.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - THAILAND: IMD5016_
         |
         | Under the 2007 Constitution, a new electoral system was adopted, 
         | reintroducing a modified version of a previous form of electoral 
         | system (the one preceding the 1997 constitution). There are 400 
         | single-seat districts were combined into larger districts:
         | four single-seat, 63 with two seats, and 90 with three seats. 
         | These constituencies use the Block Vote (BV) system, which allows 
         | voters to cast as many ballots as there are seats in a district.
         | Voters are not permitted to cast all their votes for a single
         | candidate but can split their votes between candidates nominated
         | by different parties, for a total of 400 seats. Parallel to this
         | tier, 80 seats are distributed according to PR list, in eight 
         | regional constituencies of roughly equivalent proportions, 
         | without a threshold. Each party submits a list with ten 
         | candidates who are listed once, and who can also contest 
         | constituency seats.

         |
         | France (2002) has been coded "97. NOT APPLICABLE" for variable
         | IMD5016_3 because members of the Senate (French Upper House) are
         | indirectly elected.

         |
         | In 1996, Taiwan held Presidential elections. Coding for variables
         | IMD5016_2 - IMD5016_4 for the Taiwanese 1996 study in MODULE 1
         | refers to the system, and not the election in question. For the
         | IMD, these codes have been changed into "97. Not applicable".
         |
         | After 2004, Taiwan underwent an electoral reform, and the 2008
         | elections were the first in Taiwan held under a mixed-member
         | system based on a two-ballot design incorporating single-member
         | districts and party-list seats.

         | Definition: Party bloc voting is used in multi-member
         | districts where voters cast a single party-centered vote for
         | their party of choice; the party with the most votes wins
         | all of the district seats.
         |
         | The coding classification differs for MODULES 1 and 2, compared
         | to MODULES 3 and 4. Data for the variable IMD5017_ was
         | harmonized, utilizing the codes from CSES MODULES 3 and 4.
         | In what follows, we list how the original categories employed in
         | the Standalone CSES MODULES were coded in CSES IMD.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - BELGIUM: IMD5017_4
         |
         | Senators from the second segment are indirectly elected, by two
         | electoral colleges (French and Dutch). Thus, all Belgium studies
         | have been coded "7. Not applicable" for the variable IMD5017_4.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - BRAZIL: IMD5017_1
         |
         | Each political party presents a list of candidates. Voters can
         | vote for a candidate, or they can vote for a party. Thus, all
         | studies have been recoded to "4. Other" for the variable
         | IMD5017_1.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - CHILE: IMD5017_
         |
         | Each political coalition presents a list of a maximum of two
         | candidates per electoral district, normally each from a
         | different party of the coalition. Voters vote for one candidate
         | of one of the lists. However, parties present lists, and thus
         | all Chile studies have been coded "2. Party lists" for the
         | variables IMD5017_1 and IMD5017_3.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - CZECH REPUBLIC/CZECHIA: IMD5017_3
         |
         | None of the Czech studies in CSES Standalone modules does deal 
         | with the upper house election in the country. Thus, all Czech 
         | studies have been recoded to "7. Not applicable" for the variable
         | IMD5017_3.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - DENMARK: IMD5017_1
         |
         | Voters can choose to endorse a party, a candidate on a party 
         | list, or an independent candidate. Parties can choose to have
         | either an open or a party-ranked list of candidates. If the 
         | list is open votes that are cast on the party (the voter has 
         | not given a personal vote) are distributed between the 
         | candidates based on the number of personal votes. If the list 
         | is party ranked a vote cast on the party will be given to the
         | candidate listed first on the list until he or she has 
         | received enough votes to be elected, and so on. Thus, all studies
         | for Denmark have been recoded to "4. Other" for variable
         | IMD5017_1.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - FRANCE: IMD5017_3
         |
         | The Upper House (Senate) of the French Parliament consists of 
         | 348 members who are indirectly elected by elected officials. 
         | Thus, all French studies have been coded "7. Not applicable" for 
         | IMD5017_3.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - GERMANY: IMD5017_3
         |
         | The Upper House (Bundesrat) of the German Parliament consists of
         | 69 members who are indirectly elected. Thus, all German studies
         | have been coded "7. Not applicable" for the variable IMD5017_3.

         | POLITY NOTES - HONG KONG: IMD5017_
         |
         | Hong Kong adopted a constitutional reform package in 2010, which
         | also affected the election law. Geographical Constituency (GC)
         | and Functional constituency (FG) constitute two segments, tiers.
         | In both tiers, voters cast a vote for candidates.
         | Please consult the POLITY NOTE for IMD5016_.
         |
         | Prior to the 2010 reform, in geographical constituency elections,
         | each voter could cast one vote for a list that includes the names
         | of one or more candidates (up to the maximum number of Legco
         | members returned by that geographical constituency). The same
         | political party (group) may put up more than one list in a
         | constituency, and candidates on a list may belong to different
         | political party (group).
         |
         | Due to the above-mentioned change, coding for Hong Kong (2012)
         | study differs from the earlier Hong Kong studies, for the
         | variables IMD5017_.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - MEXICO: IMD5017_2
         |
         | In Mexico, each voter's vote is counted twice: Once for the
         | single-member district contest, and a second time for the
         | regional PR contest. Accordingly, the voting procedure is coded
         | as voting for candidates and for a party list for each
         | respective contest. For that reason, Mexico (2003) has been
         | recoded to "2" for the variable IMD5017_2.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - MEXICO: IMD5017_3 and IMD5017_4
         |
         | In Mexico, each voter's vote for choosing senators is counted
         | twice: Once for the 3-seat multi-member districts contest, and a
         | second time for the national PR contest (see Election Study note
         | for D5038_3-4 for details). Accordingly, the voting procedure is
         | coded as voting for candidates and for a party list for each
         | respective contest.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NETHERLANDS: IMD5017_1
         |
         | A vote is always one for a list and for a candidate at the 
         | same time (matrix). A majority of voters cast their vote on 
         | the first candidate on the list. However, not all voters do
         | that. Thus, all Netherlands studies have been recoded to
         | "4. Other" for the variable IMD5017_1.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NETHERLANDS: IMD5017_3
         |
         | Members of the Senate (Eerste Kamer) of the Dutch Parliament
         | (the States General) are elected indirectly - by the members
         | of the twelve Provincial Councils. Thus, all Dutch studies have
         | been coded "7. Not applicable" for the variable IMD5017_3.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NORWAY: IMD5017_2
         |
         | Voters in Norway cast only one single ballot in the election on 
         | the basis of party lists. This vote directly impacts the  
         | selection of the 150 members elected in the 19 multi-member 
         | districts using proportional representation. However, the ballot
         | also influences the dispersion of the 19 "member at large seats". 
         | As such, when voters are casting their ballot for party lists,
         | they are also casting a ballot, albeit indirectly for the 
         | allocation of the "member at large seats". Accordingly, we code
         | this as "2. PARTY LISTS" for all Norwegian studies.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - PERU: IMD5017_1
         |
         | In Peru, voters cast one vote for a party list, but they can
         | also express optionally a preferential vote for some specific
         | candidate. They can signal up to two preferred candidates from
         | the list he has chosen. The preferential votes are taken into
         | account only to decide the order in which candidates
         | from a list will fill the seats the party has won in the
         | election. Thus, the Peruvian 2011 study has been recoded to "2" 
         | for IMD5017_1.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - POLAND: IMD5017_
         |
         | For the 1997 election, 460 members of the Polish Parliament
         | (Sejm) were elected in a two-tier system: 391 members from
         | party lists who passed a threshold of 5% of the total vote
         | (8% for registered coalitions). The remaining 69 seats were
         | reserved for parties/coalitions which (a) registered their lists
         | in at least half of the districts by collecting 3,000 valid
         | signatures in each, (b) submitted a national list of candidates,
         | and (c) gained at least 7% of the total vote. This constituted a
         | second tier.
         |
         | The new Constitution from 1997, and a change of administrative
         | divisions adopted in 1999, required a change of the electoral 
         | system. New rules were implemented for the 2001 elections.
         | One of the most important changes included the final liquidation 
         | of party list vote, and the liquidation of the second tier.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - ROMANIA: IMD5017_1 and IMD5017_3
         |
         | Romania (2009 and 2014) studies are about Presidential
         | elections. Thus, these two studies have been coded "7. Not
         | applicable" for the variable IMD5017_3.
         |
         | The remaining three Romanian studies are concerned with the 
         | Parliamentary election. The Romanian 1996 and 2004 studies are
         | coded "2. Party lists" because from 1992 to 2008, Romania used
         | proportional systems, closed lists, for the Upper house
         | elections. The Romanian 2012 study is coded "4. Other" because
         | from 2008 to 2016, Romania used a mixed-member proportional
         | system - voters had two votes, one for a party, and the other for
         | candidates.
         | In 2016 the law changed again, and Romania is now back to using
         | a proportional system with closed lists.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SLOVENIA: IMD5017_2
         |
         | In Slovenia, members of Italian and Hungarian indigenous ethnic
         | communities, under the Constitution, are entitled to two deputy
         | seats, one seat for each community.
         | For Slovenian (1996 and 2004) studies, this was treated as second
         | segment (tier). However, members of the Italian and Hungarian
         | community, as other voters in Slovenia, cast one vote, and even
         | though they are calculated separately, they do not constitute a
         | separate tier. Thus, all Slovenia studies are recoded to "7. Not
         | applicable" in CSES IMD for IMD5017_2.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SPAIN: IMD5017_3
         |
         | The Upper House (Senate) of Spain Parliament (Cortes Generales),
         | constitutes of 266 members. Regional legislatures designate
         | their representatives for the Senate (58 members). The remaining
         | 208 senators are directly elected.
         |
         | For the Upper House election, Spain uses single non-transferable
         | vote (limited voting), where voters have fewer votes than there
         | are positions available. Parties present a list of three names,
         | but voters cast votes for candidates. Each voter may mark up to
         | three candidates' names, from any party. Even though they are
         | allowed to give their votes to candidates from different party
         | lists (panachage), this happens rarely, and the four Senators are
         | usually the three candidates from the most popular party and the
         | first placed candidate from the next most popular.
         |
         | Thus, all Spain studies have been coded "4. Other" for the
         | variable IMD5017_3.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SWITZERLAND: IMD5017_1
         |
         | Swiss voters can cast their vote in many different ways. Among
         | others they can a) simply vote for a party list, b) endorse
         | specific candidates from the party list, c) add candidates from
         | other parties instead of a candidate of the list (panachage),
         | d) delete candidates or vote twice for the same candidate
         | (cumulation). Due to these varieties in options for voters, all
         | Swiss studies have been coded "4. Other" for the variable
         | IMD5017_1.

         | POLITY NOTES - TAIWAN: IMD5017_2
         |
         | The electoral law in 2008 changed the rules for legislative
         | elections to a mixed-member majoritarian (MMM) system, and the
         | total number of seats has been reduced to 113. Among them,
         | 73 seats are elected based on the single-member districts (SMD),
         | 34 seats based on the proportional representation (PR) in a
         | nationwide district, and six seats for the aboriginals.
         |
         | Previously, the Legislative Yuan had 225 seats; 168 legislators 
         | from the special municipalities, counties, and cities (29 such
         | primary districts); four seats for members of plains Aborigine
         | tribes and four for members of mountain Aborigine tribes, eight 
         | seats representing the overseas Taiwanese community, and 41 
         | 'at-large' legislators. In case of overseas and 'at large' seats,
         | political parties are given those seats to fill, based on their
         | percentage (national) of the vote. Since Taiwanese voters cast
         | only single nontransferable votes (SNTV), the country is coded as
         | having one segment, but primary and secondary districts.
         |
         | Thus, there is a difference in coding for Taiwanese studies 
         | before and after the 2008 change of law. Additionally, the 
         | Taiwanese 1996 study, for the same reason, has been recoded to 
         | "7. Not applicable" for IMD5017_2.

         | POLITY NOTES - TAIWAN: IMD5017_3-IMD5017_4
         |
         | Constitutional amendments promulgated on April 25, 2000,
         | established a unicameral legislative system in Taiwan. Thus,
         | coding for Taiwan (1996) study from MODULE 1 differs from all
         | following Taiwan studies. For all the following studies,
         | starting from 2001 study, variables IMD5017_3 and IMD5017_4 are
         | coded "7. Not applicable."

         | Data for IMD5018_ are available in the Standalone CSES MODULE 5
         | dataset, but these data are not yet available in CSES IMD.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - CHILE: IMD5018_3
         |
         | In 2005, a constitutional reform in Chile eliminated all the
         | appointed seats in the Senate, as well as those held by previous
         | Presidents. Later reforms in 2017 made the Chilean Senate a
         | 50-member body, with senators elected for an eight-year term.
         | Senate elections are held every four years for approximately
         | half the seats. All the voting for Senators happens in one round.
         | Thus, all Chilean studies have been coded "1" for IMD5018_3.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - HONG KONG: IMD5018_
         |
         | In geographical constituency elections, there is only one round
         | of voting. Thus, all Hong Kong studies in CSES IMD have been
         | recoded to 1.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NORWAY: IMD5018_
         |
         | Voters in Norway cast only one single ballot in the election on 
         | the basis of party lists. This vote directly impacts the  
         | selection of the 150 members elected in  the 19 multi-member 
         | districts using proportional representation. However, the ballot
         | also influences the dispersion of the 19 "member at large seats" 
         | As such, when voters are casting their ballot for party lists
         | they are also casting a ballot, albeit indirectly, for the
         | allocation of the "member at large seats". However, since this
         | is a single ballot (single vote) in the same round, all Norwegian
         | studies have been coded "1" for IMD5018_.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELARUS (2008): IMD5018_1
         |
         | The electoral law of the March 15, 1994 Constitution (Art. 64-72) 
         | stipulates that Belarus has a majority/plurality electoral 
         | system composed of two rounds. 
         | Parline describes that "In the first round, voting is 
         | considered valid if over 50 percent of eligible voters take 
         | part in the polls. Candidates who receive over 50 percent of
         | votes are declared elected. If none of the candidates obtains 50 
         | percent of votes, a runoff election between the two leading 
         | candidates is held within two weeks. Runoff elections are
         | considered valid if more than 25 percent of eligible voters 
         | take part. The candidate securing a simple majority of votes 
         | wins the seat. If the second round of voting is held for only
         | one candidate, the candidate needs to obtain the support of over
         | half of the voters taking part in the election.)"

         | Date accessed: August 5, 2019.
         |
         | However, in the course of the 2008 election, all 110 deputies
         | were elected in the first round of voting (more than 50 % 
         | of voters took part, and each of the 110 elected candidates
         | received more than 50 % of votes). Thus, the second round was 
         | not necessary in any electoral district, such that the variable
         | IMD5018_1 is coded "1."

         |
         | Hong Kong underwent a change in electoral rules in 2010, and
         | these changes were applied in the 2012 elections. One of the
         | novelties of the system is introducing five new members elected
         | from Functional constituencies (FC), which are special interest
         | groups involved in the elections. These additions have been

         | appointed by the Governor-General, on the advice of Prime
         | Minister. Since Senators are indirectly elected, all Canadian

         | POLITY NOTES - JAPAN: IMD5022_1
         |
         | In the single-member districts of the Lower House contest, as
         | well as for the prefecture-level districts of the Upper House,
         | a candidate needs to obtain votes at least equal to one-sixth
         | of the quotient obtained by dividing the total of valid ballots
         | cast by the number of seats to be filled from the constituency
         | concerned. For all single-member districts of the lower house
         | contest this equals obtaining at least 1/6 (16.7%) of
         | the total valid votes. Instead, the multi-member prefecture
         | -level districts of the Upper House contest have variable
         | district magnitudes with a minimum of one and a maximum of five. 
         | In this case, this quotient varies from 16.6% to 3.33% of the 
         | valid votes.
         | This rule has been in force for all of the elections covered by
         | studies included in CSES. However, some minor differences may
         | occur due to rounding issues of statistical software packages.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - NEW ZEALAND: IMD5022_2
         |
         | New Zealand has an alternative threshold: Parties with more than  
         | 5% of the total votes nationally on the basis of the party list 
         | votes ('party vote', tier 2) or those who have won one of the 70
         | constituency seats (tier 1) are entitled to sit in parliament  
         | and may be eligible to receive a proportional share of the 50  
         | list seats on the basis of their national vote share.
         | Thus, New Zealand (2008) coded in Standalone MODULE 3 dataset "5"
         | has been recoded to 96, like the other New Zealand studies in
         | CSES.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SOUTH AFRICA: IMD5022_1
         |
         | South Africa is one national district with a magnitude of four
         | hundred. There is no legal threshold for gaining representation.
         | Thus, all South Africa studies have been recoded to 0 for
         | variable IMD5022_1

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SOUTH AFRICA: IMD5022_3 & IMD5022_4
         |
         | South Africa's National Council of Provinces (Upper house)
         | comprises 90 provincial delegates, who are indirectly
         | elected. Thus, all South African studies have been coded
         | "97. Not applicable" for the variables IMD5022_3 and IMD5022_4.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SOUTH KOREA: IMD5022_2
         |
         | The threshold applies to the nationwide proportional district: 
         | 3% of the total valid votes for party lists, or at least five  
         | primary district seats.
         | Thus, South Korea (2008) has been recoded to "96. OTHER
         | THRESHOLD [SEE ELECTION STUDY NOTES]."

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - CANADA (2008): IMD5022_2
         |
         | Canada uses plurality voting, i.e., a "first-past-the-post" 
         | system, with single-member electoral divisions. Thus, it is a 
         | single-tier system, and the Canadian 2008 study has been recoded
         | to "97. Not applicable" for variable IMD5022_2.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - IRELAND (2007): IMD5022_3
         |
         | The upper house of the Irish Parliament (Oireachtas) consists of 
         | members which are not directly elected. Thus, the Irish 2007

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - PERU (2011): IMD5022_3 & IMD5022_4
         |
         | Peru's Parliament (Congress of the Republic of Peru) is a
         | unicameral body. Thus, the Peruvian 2011 study has been recoded 
         | to "97. Not applicable" for variables IMD5022_3 and IMD5022_4.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - ROMANIA (2009): IMD5022_2 & IMD5022_4
         |
         | The CSES survey was conducted for the 2009 Presidential
         | Election in Romania. Thus, the study has been recoded to 
         | "97. Not applicable" for variables IMD5022_2 and IMD5022_4.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - ROMANIA (2012): IMD5022_1 & IMD5022_3
         |
         | The threshold for political parties to obtain seats is 5% of the
         | valid votes. However, it is higher for electoral alliances 
         | comprising of more parties: 
         |    - A threshold of 8% of valid votes for coalitions 
         |      of two parties. 
         |    - A threshold of 9% of valid votes for coalitions 
         |      of three parties. 
         |    - A threshold of 10% of valid votes for coalitions 
         |      of four parties or more. 
         | Alternatively, a party that wins six district seats in the 
         | Chamber of Deputies or three district seats in the Senate 
         | may also receive seats.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - SOUTH AFRICA (2009): IMD5022_2
         |
         | South Africa is a one-tier (segment) system. Thus, South Africa
         | (2009) study has been coded "97. Not applicable" for the

         | has been recoded from "13" to "14" in CSES IMD.
         |
         | In accordance with the coding standard above, IMD5025_W is
         | coded "1. ELECTION HELD ON WEEKDAY" for all Norwegian studies
         | included in IMD.

         | 2006. The election, however, took place on two consecutive days, 
         | starting one day earlier on Sunday, April 9, 2006.  
         | Hence, IMD5025_2 was recoded from "10" to "9" in CSES IMD.
         | Further, IMD5025_W is classified as "2. ELECTION HELD ON WEEKEND
         | & WEEKDAY" for Italy (2006), as elections lasted from Sunday, 
         | April 9, to Monday, April 10, 2006.

         | facilitate early voting and prevent crowding at polling stations 
         | due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The election was originally
         | scheduled for March 17, 2021. The dataset characterizes this date

         | Next to the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's lower house, Taiwan also 
         | had a directly elected National Assembly, which was formally 
         | abolished only in 2005. 
         | The National Assembly originally had two main powers: Electing 
         | the President and Vice President, and amending the constitution. 
         | Since 1996, the President and Vice President have been elected 
         | directly. 
         | As of 2000, the National Assembly was only to be elected ad hoc 
         | whenever constitutional amendments were proposed by the 
         | Legislative Yuan. Since then, the National Assembly has gathered
         | only once after its direct elections in 2005, to vote on the 
         | constitutional amendment to suspend itself until a reunification 
         | with Mainland China. 
         | However, since direct elections to the National Assembly last
         | took place in 2005, Taiwan is coded as a bicameral system for
         | the Taiwanese election studies in 1996, 2001 and 2004 and as
         | a unicameral system thereafter.

         | there are some exceptions to this, but CSES does not classify 
         | partially elected unicameral systems). For bicameral systems, 
         | CSES classifies whether the chamber is fully directly elected by 
         | voters, partially elected, or indirectly elected. 
         |
         | Bicameral legislatures are classified as having fully directed

         | are awarded to women in a separate election in 47 counties, where
         | each county constitutes a single-member constituency. Further, 12
         | representatives are appointed, which makes a total number of 349 
         | representatives. In addition, the Speaker of the Assembly holds
         | a seat who is an ex officio member.
         | The Senate has 68 seats, of which 47 are elected from single-
         | member constituencies based on the counties using first-past-
         | the-post, and the remaining 21 are appointed; 16 women based on 
         | party's seat numbers, two representing disabled groups and two

         | POLITY NOTES - GERMANY: IMD5027
         |
         | Constitutionally, the Bundestag consists of 598 seats. Half
         | of the members (299) are elected in single-member districts
         | using the first past the post electoral system (the "first
         | vote") The remaining 299 seats are filled by proportional
         | representation using the party list (the "second vote"). 
         | 
         | Until the Bundestag elections in 2009, so-called overhang 
         | mandates (i.e., additional seats) were allocated to parties
         | winning more seats in single-member districts than they were
         | entitled to according to their vote share obtained by 
         | proportional representation. Thus, overhang mandates 
         | potentially changed the proportional composition of
         | parliament to the benefit of larger parties.
         |
         | Since 2013, compensatory seats are allocated to all 
         | parties not benefiting from overhang mandates.
         | 
         | The following table lists the number of overhang mandates 
         | (until 2009) plus compensatory seats (since 2013) and the
         | resulting size of the Bundestag after each German election

         | POLITY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND: IMD5027
         |
         | Conventionally, the New Zealand Parliament has 120 members. 
         | However, this can sometimes increase due to 'overhang' seats, 
         | which arise when a party gains more constituency seats (tier 1)
         | than its party list vote (tier 2) would entitle it to on a  
         | proportional basis.

         |
         | IMD5028 details the total cabinet size before the election, based 
         | on the following definition adopted by CSES: 
         | a) Parliamentary and Semi-Presidential Regimes:
         |    Cabinet size is defined by the total number of ministers
         |    (persons, not posts) in a defined government. Ministers are
         |    considered members of a cabinet when they exercise voting
         |    rights. This number includes both ministers with and without
         |    portfolio, but excludes deputy ministers, undersecretaries,
         |    parliamentary secretaries, ministerial alternates, given that
         |    in the majority of cases, they do not exercise full voting
         |    rights.
         | b) Presidential Regimes:
         |    Cabinet size is defined by the total number of ministers or
         |    secretaries who head a ministry.

         | In the context of Hong Kong, the Executive Council (ExCo) can be
         | regarded as the cabinet. The ExCo comprises the Official Members
         | (all the Principal Officials in the government secretariat have
         | been appointed concurrently the Official Members of the ExCo
         | since July 2002) and the Non-official Members. The members of
         | the ExCo are appointed by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
         | Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), while the Principal
         | Officials are nominated by the Chief Executive and are appointed
         | by the Central People's Government of China. Figures reported in
         | IMD5029 refer to non-official members (without portfolios) of

         | In Hong Kong, the Executive Council (equivalent to the
         | cabinet elsewhere) consists of the CE (one), official members (15
         | principal government officials known as "secretaries", who
         | are CS, Financial Secretary, Secretary for Justice and 12 bureau
         | secretaries) and unofficial members (15 before the 2008 
         | Election). Altogether, the Executive Council had 31 members
         | before the 2008 LegCo Elections. 
         | Before the Election, the CE and the official members were not
         | members of any political parties; four of the 15 unofficial 
         | members were members of political parties (groups). (From the
         | Macro Report.)

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2012): IMD5029

         | In Hong Kong, the Executive Council (ExCo), which is established
         | to assist the Chief Executive (CE; equivalent of Prime Minister,
         | or President) in policymaking, is some equivalent of the cabinet
         | elsewhere. However, the majority views of the ExCo, if any, are 
         | not binding, and it is up to the CE to decide whether to accept 
         | them or not. In this sense, the ExCo members do not have voting
         | rights. The ExCo had 30 members (including the CE, 15 official 
         | members and 14 non-official members). Only three of the ExCo 
         | members have party affiliation, reported in this variable. One 
         | of the three members belongs to the party Rural Council.

         | In Hong Kong, the Executive Council (ExCo), which is established
         | to assist the Chief Executive (CE; equivalent to Prime Minister
         | or President) in policy-making, is equivalent to the cabinet
         | elsewhere. However, the majority views of the ExCo, if any, are 
         | not binding, and it remains the CE's prerogative to accept 
         | recommendations or not. Thus, it can be argued the ExCo members 
         | do not have voting rights per se. 
         | ExCo consisted of the CE and 30 members (16 official members and
         | 14 non-official members) prior to the 2016 LegCo Election (as of  
         | December 31, 2015). Only five of the ExCo members have a party 
         | affiliation, reported in this variable.

         | 
         | As before, the body administering the election law in Hong Kong 
         | (the Electoral Affairs Commission) largely considered the 2016 
         | LegCo Election as impartial. However, in this election, 
         | there was one incident that led to queries over the body's 
         | impartiality: Returning officers under the Electoral Affairs 
         | Commission decided that six persons were not qualified for 
         | running for LegCo on the ground that judging from their past 
         | remarks and social media posts, the disqualified persons 
         | advocated Hong Kong independence, so could not genuinely support
         | the Basic Law (according to which Hong Kong is an inalienable 
         | part of China). Since in previous elections, returning officers
         | had never made these kinds of political judgments, some perceived
         | their decisions as political censorship over who could run for 
         | LegCo Election and rejection of the candidacy of some persons on
         | political grounds. (From the Macro Report.)

         | IMD5035 reports the number of parties participating in the
         | main election.
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for IMD3002_OUTGOV specifying the main election 
         | for each study in CSES for specific details.

         | The 1996 and 2004 Australian election studies were originally 
         | coded as "1. Yes" in the Standalone CSES MODULES 1 and 2. They 
         | were recoded into "0. No" in CSES IMD to code all Australian
         | studies consistently. According to the Australian collaborator, 
         | inconsistencies might have likely occurred because electoral
         | alliances are not allowed technically but in practice, it is 
         | slightly ambiguous because of the permanent Liberal-National
         | Coalition.

         | [ELECTION STUDY NOTES] - CANADA (2008, 2011, 2015): IMD5036_1

         | and 4. They were recoded into "1. Yes" in CSES IMD to code all
         | Canadian studies consistently. According to the Canadian 
         | collaborator, electoral alliances were allowed in Canada but
         | they just did not exist. The collaborator suspects that this
         | might be the source of the different responses.

         | thus, deviates from the coding of the other Japanese election 
         | studies. It is coded as "Yes" because in theory electoral
         | alliances can be formed legally. However, in practice the
         | question is vague. There was some informal agreement which
         | enables the parties concerned to cooperate in the Election

         | During the harmonization, we found a couple of inconsistencies

         | 2004/2012/2014: Classified as "1. YES JOINT PARTY LISTS MUST         
         |                 SATISFY HIGHER THRESHOLDS"
         | 1996: Classified as "3. YES, JOINT PARTY LISTS ARE SUBJECT 
         |       TO OTHER REGULATIONS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE

         | 2009: Classified as "5. NO, JOINT PARTIES ARE GOVERNED BY THE

         | The 2007 French election study is classified as "5. NO, JOINT
         | PARTIES ARE GOVERNED BY THE SAME RULES AS OTHER PARTIES"
         | deviating from other classifications of French elections across
         | time. In the French electoral system, there are no electoral
         | lists, so this question refers to multiple parties endorsing
         | 'joint' candidates. In practice, candidates may declare to voters
         | as many endorsements as they wish. Yet, for party funding (which
         | is almost the only regulation on parties in France), candidates
         | can declare only one endorsement even if they receive money from
         | more than one party.

         | the candidate's name appears once on the ballot, together with 
         | the names of all supporting parties. However, the French 2002 
         | study focuses on Presidential elections. In case of Presidential

         | the names of all supporting parties. However, while a candidate 
         | standing in tier 1 ('electorate vote') may have an endorsement 
         | from another party, it is usually tacit rather than direct and 
         | usually the main party of the candidate is the one that appears 
         | on the ballot paper. Therefore, IMD5040_2 has been recoded to

         | 
         | For the U.S. 1996 and 2004 election studies, IMD5040_2 was 
         | originally coded as "3" in the Standalone CSES MODULES 1 and 2, 
         | suggesting that in case of multi-party endorsements, the 
         | candidate's name appeared once on the ballot, together with 
         | the names of all supporting parties. However, nearly all of the
         | options listed in IMD5040_2 are possible in the United States,
         | with the rules varying by state. Hence, IMD5040_2 has been 
         | recoded to "5. OTHER" for United States 1996 and 2004, in line 
         | with the U.S. 2008 and 2012 studies.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ARGENTINA (2015): IMD5044
         |
         | While voters in Argentina can cast a fused vote, Argentine
         | election law considers each election (the Presidential
         | and legislative elections) to be a separate choice and thus a 
         | voter casting a fused ballot is considered to have made two 
         | individual choices. According to the Argentine collaborator,  
         | voters can and regularly do split their votes by physically
         | cutting their ballot paper in half and thus combining a 
         | vote for a Presidential candidate for one party/alliance and 
         | a legislative vote for another party/alliance. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - URUGUAY (2009): IMD5044
         |
         | Voters have a single vote. However, each ballot contains a
         | Presidential ticket, a closed list for Senate, and a closed 
         | list for the Lower Chamber. Each ballot must necessarily 
         | contain lists of a single party. Electors cast votes necessarily
         | (for President and two chambers) for the same party. Hence, the
         | election results are basically identical for all three
         | institutions - both houses of the Parliament, and for the
         | President (first round).

         | [POLITY NOTES] - GREECE: IMD5045_1
         | 
         | The 2009 Greek election study was originally coded as having 
         | two tiers in the CSES Standalone MODULE 3. To be consistent with 
         | 2012 and 2015, the 2009 election study was recoded into three 
         | tiers in CSES IMD. Please consult IMD5041_.
         | For the Greek 2009 election, there were in total 300 seats, of
         | which 248 were awarded in 56 multi-member districts in the first
         | tier. Thus, the Greek 2009 study is set to 4.42 for IMD5045_1.
         | For the Greek 2012 and January 2015 elections, there were in 
         | total 300 seats, out of which 238 were awarded in 56 multi-member
         | districts. Thus, the Greek 2012 and January 2015 studies are set

         | 
         | The 1999 and 2003 Icelandic election studies were originally 
         | coded as having an average district magnitude of 6.2 and 10.5 
         | in the Standalone CSES MODULES 1 and 2, respectively.
         | The Icelandic parliament has 63 seats. According to the 
         | Icelandic constitution, the sizes of the lower and upper tier 
         | for the 1999 election were not fixed. Rather, up to one-fourth 
         | of seats for each constituency were eligible to be allocated at
         | the national level (tier 2), equaling 13 out of 63 seats. 
         | The remaining 50 seats were awarded in eight multi-member 
         | districts. Hence, data for Iceland 1999 has been recoded to  
         | 6.25 for IMD5045_1 (50 divided by eight).
         | For the 2003 elections, constitutional amendments reduced the
         | number of multi-member districts to 6, and set the number of
         | seats to be returned from tier 1 to 54. Therefore, data for 
         | Iceland 2003 has been recoded to 9.00 (54 divided by 6), in 
         | accordance with later Icelandic studies included in CSES.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ESTONIA (2011): IMD5045_1
         |
         | The Estonian parliament consists of 101 members elected via 12
         | multi-member districts. Seats are allocated across three tiers.
         | The first tier involves seats allocated by personal mandates
         | determined by Hare quota. Candidates are awarded a seat if their
         | vote surpasses the quota. Here, the average district magnitude
         | value is 8.42 (101/12). The second tier is the allocation of
         | seats based on the party list. Seats are awarded to
         | parties/coalitions based on the number of times the
         | party/coalition exceeds the district's quota. The third tier is
         | compensatory seats between the national lists of
         | parties/alliances whose candidates obtained at least 5% of the
         | national vote or three candidates. As the second and third-tier
         | magnitudes vary in each election, these values (IMD5045_2 and
         | IMD5045_3 respectively) are set to "999. MISSING", with the
         | average district magnitude for Estonia reported in IMD5045_1.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - DENMARK: IMD5045_2
         | 
         | The 1998 and 2001 Danish election studies were originally coded
         | as having one electoral segment in the Standalone CSES MODULES 
         | 1 and 2. However, according to the electoral law applicable to
         | the 1998 and 2001 elections, Denmark employed two electoral 
         | segments: 
         | The first tier consisted of 135 seats from 17 multi-member
         | constituencies, with an average district magnitude of 7.94 
         | (135 divided by 17). 
         | The second tier awarded 40 compensatory seats on a national 
         | level, resulting in a district magnitude of 40. Hence, data for 
         | Denmark 1998 and 2002 in IMD5045_2 were corrected for the IMD.   
         |
         | The 2006 electoral reform reduced the number of multi-member 
         | districts in tier 1 from 17 to 10, resulting in an increase
         | in average district magnitude from 7.94 to 13.50 (135 / 10).

         | [POLITY NOTES] - GERMANY: IMD5045_2
         | 
         | Data on IMD5045_2 has been coded inconsistently for Germany 
         | in the Standalone CSES Modules. Inconsistencies occur because 
         | average district magnitude in the second tier in Germany is 
         | liable to change depending on whether overhang or compensatory 
         | seats are allotted or not (see POLITY NOTES on IMD5027 for 
         | details). 
         | For Germany, IMD5045_2 reflects average district magnitude 
         | disregarding compensatory seats. Specifically, until the 1998 
         | election, the second tier returned 328 seats to the Bundestag, 
         | with separate party lists for each of the 16 Laender. Hence, the
         | value for 1998 is 20.5 (328 divided by 16). 
         | In 2002, the number of seats allocated in the second tier were 
         | reduced to 299, resulting in an average district magnitude of 
         | 18.69 (299 divided by 16), which is the value the IMD reflects 
         | for the 2002 and later studies.

         | 
         | The 2009 Greek election study was originally coded as having 
         | two tiers in the CSES Standalone MODULE 3. To be consistent with 
         | 2012 and 2015, the 2009 election study was recoded into three 
         | tiers in CSES IMD. Please consult IMD5041_.
         | For all three elections, there were 12 national-level seats.
         | Thus, all three Greek studies (2009, 2012, and 2015) are coded
         | 12.00 for IMD5045_2.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - HONG KONG: IMD5045_2
         | 
         | Hong Kong has a unicameral legislature, the Legislative Council. 
         | Since the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
         | Region (HKSAR) in 1997, a proportion of the legislative council 
         | is returned by popular geographic constituency elections; the
         | remaining seats are returned by indirect functional constituency 
         | elections, with the precise number of returned seats varying
         | over time.
         | In the Geographical Constituency (GC) election (tier 1), 
         | Hong Kong is divided into five constituencies, and voters elect 
         | candidates by universal suffrage. In the "traditional" 
         | Functional (FC) election, voter registration requires special 
         | qualifications in some FCs, such as being a registered medical 
         | practitioner or dentist for the Medical FC. 
         | In CSES MODULE 1, the traditional FCs were coded as second tier. 
         | However, since suffrage for the traditional FCs is limited, 
         | the CSES IMD regards Hong Kong as a one-tier system until the 
         | electoral reform in 2010. That reform first applicable to the 
         | 2012 election introduced an additional tier, the District Council 
         | (Second) Functional Constituency (tier 2). This segment returns 
         | five LegCo members from one general constituency.

         | tiers for lower house elections (See POLITY NOTES on IMD5045_1
         | for details). 
         | In 1999, the second and national-level tier returned 13 seats, 
         | equaling an average district magnitude of 13.00. Since 2003, 
         | the number of seats awarded in the national-level tier has been
         | reduced to nine, resulting in an average district magnitude 
         | of 9.00. Data on IMD5045_2 for Iceland 1999 and 2003 have been

         | having one electoral segment in the Standalone CSES MODULES 1 
         | and 2. However, for all studies included in IMD, Sweden employed 
         | two electoral segments: 
         | Since 1997, Sweden's first electoral segment returns 310 seats
         | from 29 multi-member districts, with seats being allocated by 
         | Modified Sainte-Lague. The national-level second tier consists 
         | of 39 adjustment seats to strengthen proportionality. Hence, 
         | IMD5045_2 has been recoded to 39.00 for the IMD (39 divided by

         | 
         | The 2001 and 2004 Taiwanese studies were originally coded as 
         | having one electoral segment in CSES MODULE 2. However, for the
         | respective elections, Taiwan employed two electoral segments: 
         | The first tier consisted of 29 multi-member districts in 
         | which 168 mandates were awarded by single non-transferable vote. 
         | The second tier returned 41 seats by proportional representation
         | in a nationwide district. Hence, data on IMD5045_2 has been 
         | recoded to 45.00 (45 divided by 1) for Taiwan 2001 and 2004. 
         | The electoral system changed significantly for the 2008 and 2012
         | elections: The first tier was reduced to 73 seats elected from
         | single-member districts by first-past-the-post, while the number
         | of seats returned in the second tier decreased to 34.

         |
         | The Estonian parliament consists of 101 members elected via 12
         | multi-member districts. Seats are allocated across three tiers.
         | The first tier involves seats allocated by personal mandates
         | determined by Hare quota. Candidates are awarded a seat if their
         | vote surpasses the quota. Here, the average district magnitude
         | value is 8.42 (101/12). The second tier is the allocation of
         | seats based on the party list. Seats are awarded to
         | parties/coalitions based on the number of times the
         | party/coalition exceeds the district's quota. The third tier is
         | compensatory seats between the national lists of
         | parties/alliances whose candidates obtained at least 5% of the
         | national vote or three candidates. As the second and third-tier
         | magnitudes vary in each election, these values (IMD5045_2 and
         | IMD5045_3 respectively) are set to "999. MISSING", with the
         | average district magnitude for Estonia reported in IMD5045_1.

         | 
         | The 2003 Mexican election study was originally coded as having
         | one electoral segment in CSES MODULE 2. However, for all studies 
         | included in CSES, Mexico employs a two-tier system for lower
         | house elections: 
         | The first tier returns 300 seats from single-member districts
         | by plurality, while the second tier returns 200 seats from 
         | five multi-member districts by proportional representation. 
         | Hence, IMD5045_2 has been recoded to 40.00 for Mexico 2003 
         | (200 divided by 5), in accordance with all other Mexican 
         | studies included in the IMD. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - POLAND (1997): IMD5045_2
         | 
         | Until 2001, Poland employed a two-tier electoral system: 
         | The first tier returned 391 seats from 52 multi-member districts
         | to the Sejm, resulting in an average district magnitude of 7.52 
         | (391 divided by 52). The second tier consisted of a 69-seat 
         | national list, with an average district magnitude of 69.00. 
         | The upper national tier was abolished in a new electoral law 
         | passed in March 2001, before the September 2001 lower house 
         | election.

         | Definition: In systems with preferential voting, a voter can
         | express a list of preferences. For example, votes can be cast 
         | by putting a '1' in the column next to the voter's preferred 
         | candidate, a '2' beside their second favorite candidate and 
         | so on. Votes are counted according to the first preferences and
         | any candidates who have achieved the predetermined quota are 
         | elected. To decide which of the remaining candidates are elected
         | the votes are transferred from candidates who have more than the

         | New York. Cambridge University Press.
         |
         | In CSES IMD, classifications of political regimes mainly rely on
         | the following decision rule as presented by Cheibub, 2007:
         | 
         | A. The system is parliamentary either (i) if there is no
         | independently (indirectly or directly) elected President or (ii)
         | if there is an independently (indirectly or directly) elected
         | President but the government is not responsible to the
         | President.
         | B. The system is mixed either if there is an independently
         | (indirectly or directly) elected President and government is
         | responsible to the President.
         | C. The system is Presidential if the government is not 
         | responsible to the elected legislature.
         |
         | NOTE: Responsibility refers to whether the survival of the
         | executive depends directly on legislature (i.e. vote of
         | confidence).
         |
         | However, researchers are advised that in a small number of 
         | cases, coding employed in IMD diverges from regime 
         | classifications as suggested by Cheibub. We detail these 
         | instances in ELECTION STUDY notes below. 
         | Further, all polities included in IMD are classified according 
         | to the above coding scheme, irrespective of their democratic 
         | status. Researchers interested in democracy ratings may
         | refer to IMD5050_ (Freedom House) or IMD5051_ (Polity IV).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2017): IMD5048
         |
         | Austrian executive power is coded as Mixed or Semi-Presidential,
         | given that the President can dissolve the National Council.
         | Article 29 of the Constitution states: 
         | "(1) The Federal President can dissolve the National Council,
         | but he may avail himself of this prerogative only once for the 
         | same reason." However, in practice, the system works mostly
         | like a parliamentary system.

         | POLITY NOTES - FINLAND: IMD5048
         |
         | Classifying the Finnish executive power is subject to some 
         | controversy. In the CSES Standalone Modules and in IMD, 
         | Finland is coded as 2. MIXED REGIME, although Cheibub
         | classifies it as parliamentary. 
         | Some key features of the Finnish system that distinguish
         | it from a traditional parliamentary system are that by 
         | constitution a) the President is popularly elected by direct 
         | vote for a fixed term of six years, and for no more than two 
         | consecutive terms of office; b) the President can, on 
         | recommendation of the Prime Minister, dissolve the legislature; 
         | c) the President can veto legislature, though parliament can 
         | override the Presidential veto with a simple majority; and 
         | d) the President may issue decrees that have the force of law. 
         | Nonetheless, it has been argued that Finland, after 
         | constitutional reforms in the 1990s works in practice as a 
         | parliamentary system. 

         | POLITY NOTES - ICELAND: IMD5048
         |
         | The coding of Iceland on IMD5048 is subject to various
         | interpretations, with different sources providing diverging
         | assessments (DPI classifies it as parliamentary and Matt Golder 
         | considers it Semi-Presidential). 
         | In the CSES Standalone Modules and IMD, Iceland is classified 
         | as 1. PARLIAMENTARY REGIME, although Cheibub classifies it as 
         | Semi-Presidential.
         | While Iceland does have a popularly elected President, who does 
         | have powers under the Icelandic constitution to dissolve 
         | parliament, submit a bill to parliament, and exercise emergency 
         | powers, the powers exercised have varied depending on the 
         | particular person occupying the Presidency. Accordingly, the 
         | position is largely considered ceremonial. 
         | The fact that Presidential elections often go uncontested 
         | (e.g., 2000 and 2008) highlight this. Therefore, CSES classifies 
         | Iceland as a parliamentary system.

         | POLITY NOTES - HONG KONG: IMD5048
         |
         | Hong Kong is not a sovereign state, but a Special Administrative
         | Region (SAR) in China. The Central Government authorizes the 
         | HKSAR to exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive, 
         | legislative and independent judicial power. Therefore, the HKSAR
         | Government comparable to a local government.
         | The Chief Executive (CE) is the President of the Executive 
         | Council of Hong Kong and head of the Government of the Hong 
         | Kong Special Administrative Region. The Chief Executive is 
         | elected by an 800-member Election Committee. The elected CE 
         | must then be appointed by the Central People's Government.
         | Regarding the relationship between the CE and Legislative 
         | Council, the type of executive may be regarded as some form of a
         | Presidential system, because the CE and the LegCo members are 
         | returned by different elections. 
         | According to Article 52, the CE must resign in case of refusal 
         | to sign a bill passed by a two-thirds majority of the
         | Legislative Council.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - PORTUGAL: IMD5048
         | 
         | Portugal's regime type is coded inconsistently in the 
         | Standalone Modules 3 and 4. While the Portuguese 2009 study
         | was coded as a mixed regime, the Portuguese 2015 study was coded
         | as parliamentary. 
         | Following Cheibub (2007), Portugal is regarded as 2. MIXED 
         | REGIME in IMD, as Portugal's President is directly elected
         | and the government is accountable to both to parliament and to
         | the President (Article 190 of the constitution).

         | [POLITY NOTES] - SOUTH KOREA: IMD5048
         | 
         | South Korea's regime type is coded inconsistently in the 
         | Standalone MODULES 3 and 4. While the country is coded as  
         | parliamentary for 2008 (MODULE 3), MODULE 4 classifies it 
         | as Presidential regime. 
         | The IMD follows both Cheibub and MODULE 4 in categorizing
         | South Korea as 3. PRESIDENTIAL REGIME. Apart from the 
         | President being directly elected (Article 67 of the 
         | constitution), parliament is not empowered to remove the 
         | government from office, but may only pass a formal 
         | recommendation for removal (Article 63). Although the 
         | National Assembly may impeach ministers (Article 65), that 
         | impeachment equals a suspension, with the final decision laying 
         | with the Constitutional Court. 

         | [POLITY NOTES] - TAIWAN (2012): IMD5048
         |
         | Taiwan's regime type is coded inconsistently in the 
         | Standalone MODULES 3 and 4. While Taiwan is coded as  
         | Presidential for 2008 (MODULE 3), MODULE 4 classifies the 
         | country as a mixed regime. 
         | In IMD, Taiwan is coded as 2. MIXED REGIME, following the 
         | MODULE 4 classification, although the constitution provides 
         | for the direct election of a President. Our coding decision is
         | based on the assessment that executive Yuan is responsible to 
         | the legislative Yuan, provided that the legislative Yuan is in
         | session, its members have the right to interpolate the
         | President of the Executive Yuan, and Ministers and chairmen of
         | the Commissions of the said Yuan (Article 57 of the
         | constitution). However, the legislature cannot vote no
         | confidence in the government and can be dissolved by the
         | President.

         | constitutional referendum turned the Presidency into an executive
         | post, effective with the 2018 general election. Hence, the

         | 
         | IMD5049 details the number of years since the most recent 
         | regime change. It is taken from the POLITY IV project and 
         | is based on the "DURABLE" variable.
         | 
         | Definition: The number of years since the last fundamental 
         | abrupt polity change. For polities that were formed before
         | 1800, the appropriate number of years were added to the 
         | score. The change is defined by a three-point change in 
         | the POLITY score over a period of three years or less or
         | the end of transition periods defined by the lack of stable
         | political institutions, as denoted by a standardized 
         | AUTHORITY score.
         | 
         | Denoted by the variable "Durable" from the Polity IV project.

         | [POLITY NOTES] - ISRAEL: IMD5049
         |
         | The most recent Polity IV dataset dates the last regime change 
         | in Israel back to 1981, the year of Israel's de-facto annexation
         | of the Golan Heights. However, previous versions of Polity IV 
         | used for CSES MODULES 3 and 4 set 1948 as the year in which 
         | Israel's last regime change occurred. CSES does not
         | retroactively update estimates as to do so might impede
         | replication. Therefore, for all Israeli election studies in the
         | CSES IMD, IMD5049 was coded in such a way that it dates the last
         | regime change back to 1948.

         | POLITY NOTES - PERU: IMD5049
         |
         | The age of the current regime is coded 0 for both Peru 2000 
         | and Peru 2001 - reflecting the period when Peru's President 
         | Alberto Fujimori won the elections and a controversial third 
         | term in office in May 2000, but fled the country later the same 
         | year when he was charged with corruption and human rights 
         | violations. As a consequence, early Presidential elections were
         | held in spring 2001. 

         | POLITY NOTES - RUSSIA: IMD5049
         |
         | Polity IV distinguishes two recent regime changes in Russia: one  
         | in 1992 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, meaning the 
         | the 1999 Russian study is coded "7" for this variable. The second
         | regime change was classified in 2000, meaning the 2000 Russian  
         | study is coded 0 for this variable and the 2004 Russian study 
         | is coded "4" for this variable.  
                  
         | POLITY NOTES - THAILAND: IMD5049
         |
         | Thailand has experienced several breaks with democracy in its 
         | history. Polity IV marks three regime changes. The first occurs 
         | in 1992, meaning the 2001 Thai study is coded "9" for this 
         | variable. The second regime change was classified in 2006-8, 
         | meaning the 2007 Thai study is coded "0" for this variable, and
         | the third in 2011, meaning the 2011 Thai study is coded "0" for
         | this variable.

         |
         | Each country and territory is assigned a numerical rating, on a

         | However, aggregate-level macro data from the World Bank is often

         | election (T-1), and two years before election (T-2).
         |
         | Definition: The human development index (HDI) is a composite 
         | index that measures the average achievements in a country in
         | three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy
         | life; access to knowledge; and a decent standard of living. These 
         | dimensions are measured by life expectancy at birth, adult
         | literacy and combined gross enrollment in primary, secondary and
         | tertiary level education, and gross domestic product (GDP) per
         | capita in Purchasing Power Parity US dollars (PPP US$),

         |
         | As of 2010, HDI data are different from the previous
         | reports, due to the revision of the HDI methodology. Hence,

         | However, aggregate-level macro data from the World Bank is often 
         | updated retroactively as revised estimates become available.
         | These revised estimates are usually because of improved data

         | Definition based on Laakso, M. and R. Taagepera (1979)
         | '"Effective" Number of Parties: A Measure with Application to 
         | West Europe', Comparative Political Studies 12: 3-27.  
         |
         | The underlying premise of the measure is to count parties and         
         | simultaneously take account of their relative strength (i.e.,
         | their vote share). 
         |         
         | Formula: ENPP = 1/(SUM[V_i^2])
         |          where V_i represents the vote share of party i, and all
         |          parties (i=1,2...n) receiving votes are included in the
         |          calculation.
         |
         | The electoral data employed to calculate this index comes
         | from lower house elections, unless the study is focused on
         | upper house election exclusively.
         | For countries with mixed electoral systems, the electoral
         | returns come from the segment containing the most seats. If
         | there are an equal amount of seats in each segment, the results
         | come from the proportional representation segment.
         |
         | For MODULES 1 and 2, data was collected from:
         | Gallagher, Michael, 2019. "Election indices dataset" - see:

         | For MODULES 3, 4, and 5, the CSES Secretariat calculated these 
         | data for each polity's election and cross-checked it against the 
         | same source.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ARGENTINA (2015): IMD5058_1
         |
         | Calculating the effective number of electoral parties in 
         | Argentina is complex, given that parties form alliances at the
         | regional level and moreover election results data is not always
         | aggregated consistently for parties/alliances. Thus, consistent
         | estimates of this metric are difficult to arrive at, something
         | which is noted by Gallagher (2017) in his estimates of the same 
         | data. CSES estimates of this metric are arrived at using the 
         | following approach: 
         |    - Parties and alliances are treated as one party/grouping.
         |    - Only parties contesting seats in the 2015 election are 
         |      counted. Parties not contesting but who held holdover seats
         |      in parliament are not included in the estimate. 
         |    - While 158 parties are estimated to have fielded candidates
         |      in the election, the number of parties competing reduces to
         |      20 if coalitions are counted as one grouping.

         |
         | The large differences between the effective number of political
         | parties and the corrected measure stems from the very large 
         | number of independent candidates gaining a seat.
         | The residual category "other" in Belarus encompasses more than

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2016 & 2020): IMD5058_1
         |
         | As US states are responsible for election counts, results for
         | different blocs are often reported differently by each state.
         | Consequently, the ENEP estimates include results data for  
         | Independent candidates, blank votes, undervotes, and overvotes.
         | Excluding these categories, the ENEP for the 2020 contest is
         | 2.063. The ENEP estimate for the 2020 Electoral College,
         | which determines the US Presidency, is 2.09.

         | For countries with mixed electoral systems, the electoral returns
         | come from the segment containing the most seats. If there are

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ARGENTINA (2015): IMD5058_2
         |
         | Calculating the corrected effective number of electoral parties  
         | in Argentina is complex given that parties form alliances at the
         | regional level and moreover election results data is not always
         | aggregated consistently for parties/alliances. Thus, consistent
         | estimates of this metric are difficult to arrive at, something
         | which is noted by Gallagher (2017) in his estimates of the same 
         | data. CSES estimates of this metric are arrived at using the 
         | following approach: 
         |    - Parties and alliances are treated as one party/grouping.
         |    - Only parties contesting seats in the 2015 election are 
         |      counted. Parties not contesting but who held holdover seats
         |      in parliament are not included in the estimate. 
         |    - While 158 parties are estimated to have fielded candidates
         |      in the election, the number of parties competing reduces to
         |      20 if coalitions are counted as one grouping. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2013 & 2019): IMD5058_2

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELARUS (2008): IMD5058_2
         |
         | The large differences between the effective number of political
         | parties and the corrected measure stems from the very large 
         | number of independent candidates gaining a seat.
         | The residual category "other" in Belarus encompasses more than
         | 86 percent of the vote and is entirely composed of independent

         |
         | Definition based on Laakso, M. and R. Taagepera (1979):
         | '"Effective" Number of Parties: A Measure with Application to 
         | West Europe', Comparative Political Studies 12: 3-27; and  
         | Taagepera, R. (1997): 'Effective Number of Parties for 
         | incomplete Data', Electoral Studies 16: 145-151.
         |         
         | The underlying premise of the measure is to count parties and         
         | simultaneously take account of their relative strength (i.e.,
         | their vote share).       
         | Corrected Effective Number of Electoral Parties (CENEP) corrects 
         | for the "other" category using the least component method of 
         | bounds suggested by Taagepera (1997). The method requires 
         | calculating the ENEP two times. One is treating the "other" 
         | category as a single party and the second is calculating the ENEP
         | as if every seat in the "other" category belonged to a different
         | party. The CENEP is the mean of both measures.

         |    - The number of parties/alliances represented in the Chamber 
         |      of Deputies after the 2015 elections is estimated by our
         |      count to be 28. This is treating for the most part parties/

         | representatives of Hungarian and Italian minorities.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SOUTH KOREA (2012): IMD5059_1
         |
         | The data is based on the total number of representatives 
         | elected into the parliament. The data includes both the 
         | 54 representatives on the basis of a proportional tier, and 
         | the 246 representatives from the single-member constituencies.

         |
         | The Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) did not participate in the
         | elections as a political party, but fielded its candidates as 
         | independents. This figure takes into account the BDP as a 
         | political party.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2016 & 2020): IMD5059_1
         |
         | These data are calculated based on elections to the US House of 
         | Representatives. As US states are responsible for election 
         | counts, results for different blocs are often reported 
         | differently by each state. Consequently, the ENPP estimates 
         | include results data for Independent candidates, blank votes, 
         | undervotes, and overvotes. Excluding these categories, the ENEP 
         | estimate is 1.999. The 2020 election ENEP estimate for the 
         | Electoral College, which determines the US Presidency, is 1.96.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: IMD5059_2
         |
         | Definition based on Laakso, M. and R. Taagepera (1979):
         | '"Effective" Number of Parties: A Measure with Application to 
         | West Europe', Comparative Political Studies 12: 3-27; and  
         | Taagepera, R. (1997): 'Effective Number of Parties for 
         | incomplete Data', Electoral Studies 16: 145-151.
         |         
         | The underlying premise of the measure is to count parties and         
         | simultaneously take account of their relative strength (i.e.,
         | their parliamentary seat share).       
         | Corrected Effective Number of Parliamentary Parties (CENPP)  
         | corrects for the "other" category using the least component 
         | method of bounds suggested by Taagepera (1997). The method 
         | requires calculating the ENPP twice. The first treats 
         | the "other" category as a single party and the 
         | second is calculating the ENPP as if every seat in the "other"
         | category belonged to a different party. The CENEP is the 
         | mean of both measures.
         |
         | For the Formula used to calculate ENPP, see variable IMD5058_2. 
         |         
         | The electoral data employed to calculate this index comes
         | from lower house elections, unless the study is focused on
         | upper house election exclusively.
         |
         | The CSES Secretariat calculates these data for each polity's 
         | election and cross-checks it against the standard source, 
         | namely: 
         | Gallagher, Michael, 2019. "Election indices dataset" - see:

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ARGENTINA (2015): IMD5059_2
         |
         | Calculating the effective number of parliamentary parties in 
         | Argentina is complex, given that parties form alliances at the
         | regional level and moreover election results data is not always
         | aggregated consistently for parties/alliances. Thus, consistent
         | estimates of this metric are difficult to arrive at, something
         | which is noted by Gallagher (2017) in his estimates of the same 
         | data. CSES estimates of this metric are arrived at using the 
         | following approach: 
         |    - Parties and alliances are treated as one party/grouping.
         |    - All parties represented in the Chamber of Deputies post the
         |      2015 elections are included in the count, including parties 
         |      /groupings that held holdover seats but did not contest/or
         |      win additional Chamber of Deputy seats in 2015. 
         |    - The number of parties/alliances represented in the Chamber 
         |      of Deputies after the 2015 elections is estimated by our
         |      count to be 28. This is treating for the most part parties/ 
         |      alliances as one. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2013, 2019): IMD5059_2

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELARUS (2008): IMD5059_2
         |
         | The large differences between the effective number of political
         | parties and the corrected measure stems from the very large 
         | number of independent candidates gaining a seat.
         | The residual category "other" in Belarus encompasses more than
         | 86 percent of the vote, and is entirely composed of independent
         | candidates.

         |
         | Electoral returns in France contain more than one "other" 
         | category. The broader categories "regionalist", "Divers", "other
         | left wing" "other right wing" and "others" were treated as 
         | single parties where appropriate and not amalgamated in a 
         | broader "other" category.

         | been included in CSES IMD.

         | Users are advised that CSES and MARPOR/CMP sometimes classify          
         | coalitions differently in elections and across polities. For         
         | example, CSES sometimes has data solely on coalitions and not 
         | the parties comprising the alliance, while MARPOR/CMP may have 
         | data concerning the individual parties in the coalition, or 
         | vice versa. Consequently, some parties may have multiple 
         | identifiers within the MARPOR/CMP dataset across time. A non          
         | comprehensive list of these deviations are noted in Part 5  
         | of the CSES IMD Codebook in POLITY NOTES.
